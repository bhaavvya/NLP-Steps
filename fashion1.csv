179,1.0,2006,This China Silk Black Balaclava is great for keeping you warm. I love it!
180,1.0,2004,"This item is very lightweight (as you'd expect from silk underwear).  While we were using it under a costume, rather than for winter warmth, the several people using it all said it was very comfortable and not too hot inside the costume."
191,1.0,2006,"This item came in only 2 days and in perfect condition! It is a very nice ring - shiny, smooth nice weight/width!  Very impressed."
192,1.0,2006,"This ring was well worth the price. It has a lovely shine and fits true to size. It is a very light, thin ring, so it you want something heavy with a thicker consistency to the metal, this may not be for you but as I said it is well worth the price! I'm very pleased."
193,1.0,2006,"It was exactly as described.  Beautiful ring, perfect fit, classy finish.  I know I would have probably paid double the price or more had I attempted to purchase similar from a jewelry store"
194,1.0,2005,"This is a nice ring.  It is simple and elegant.  The price was quite reasonable, when compared to other stores that I searched.  I reccomend this ring as a wedding ring for a young couple just starting out.  It would be great for a college student's budget."
195,1.0,2005,it is a beautiful ring. very shiny and classy. my boyfriend loves wearing it.
196,1.0,2004,"When I first saw this offer last year, I couldn't believe it was genuine. I was used to paying $10 to $15 a pair for wool socks. When they arrived, I still found it hard to believe. But these are excellent quality socks that have held up well through heavy use and lots of washings. The three pair are serving well alongside their far more expensive drawer-mates. It's hard to imagine someone getting excited by a pair of socks, but these are worth getting excited about. I agree that a color other than gray would help to stretch these socks further in my wardrobe, but for the price... I ain't complainin'!"
197,1.0,2004,"Socks seem like a strange kind of thing on which to write a review, but these socks are special. I placed an order for a friend of mine who runs a soup kitchen in Poplar Bluff Missouri. It was an order of about 60 pairs of these socks which probably seemed pretty strange to the people at Sportsman's Guide, but they sent them anyway. I didn't think much about it until I got an e-mail from Joni, the lady in Poplar Bluff, that the socks had arrived.
She told me that you would think that the socks were made of gold the way the people at her free store responded to them. They had NEVER seen such socks!! They were soft and they were thick and warm. Most of them had never even heard of wool socks.
Now I don't think twice about wool socks because I love them but it gave me real pause to think that there were people who had never even heard of such a wonderful thing. These people couldn't believe that someone would just give them something this good. Yes, this good.
So if you're thinking of buying some of these why don't you get an extra pair or two and give them to someone who needs them. It will be an education, I promise, and your gift will reward you many times over when you experience the gratitude such a small thing can evoke."
198,1.0,2003,"I ordered these socks for my Mother's birthday and she absolutely loves them. They are thick and warm, perfect for cold Indiana winters.  Thank you."
199,0.0,2003,"I like the thicknesss of the socks and because of this, I know they'll be warm enough for anything that the snow has to offer. I would really like these socks if they came in a variety of colors; grey is not a very exciting color, however; as long as you're warm, who cares about excitement."
205,1.0,2006,"I have only owned these earrings a few weeks, but I'm quite pleased with them.  Before buying these, I had been completely unable to wear earrings for many years.  My earlobes would swell, turn red, and bleed immediately after inserting even ""hypoallergenic"" earrings.  I've tried other brands, such as Simply Whispers, which I really wanted to love, but I simply couldn't wear them.  I'd given up and given away most of my earrings and hadn't bought or tried any earrings for a few years.

When these first arrived, I had trouble inserting them because my earlobes had almost grown closed, and I traumatized my ears a bit.  Over the next several days, I removed them at night, then irritated my ears again when I reinserted them in the morning.  Finally, I decided to just leave them in and allow my ears to heal, and that has worked just fine.  Now my ears have healed, and I haven't bothered to remove the earrings for a couple of weeks.

I noticed that in a review for one of the other styles, the reviewer had two complaints: that the ad appeared misleading in that it looked like you were purchasing three pairs of earrings, and that the 3mm size was tiny.  So take note:  you are ordering just one pair of earrings, and the 3mm (mini) size earrings are very small - take a look at a ruler to get an idea - but they provide an understated bit of sparkle.

I highly recommend these for people with metal allergies - I'm planning to get another pair."
231,1.0,2006,"These are the most comfortable things I have ever worn on my feet; I bought them for gymnastics and I'm so happy that I did; They are so comfortable! But just in case you didn't know: the straps are only attached at the back of the slipper; So you have to sew them into the front- I'm assuming for proper fit; This is a bit annoying- coupled with the fact that there is no loop or area of fabric to sew them into without having to see your handy work through the front(no good if your terrible at sewing like me); And they soil easily;This should be expected of course(especially if they are white). Still, as my title suggests,they earn 5 stars and more because they truly are that comfortable; Especially when walking on carpet; I can't well explain why, because the shoes really have no padding; But they hug your feet and support your arch to an extent (I'm assuming these would not be as comfortable for flat footed people).The price is great and, if you are into ballet, what do you have to loose."
240,1.0,2006,"Wearing the same style Betulas purchased years ago (and they're still going strong!), I was so sure of my size that I ordered 3 new pairs in assorted colors. Well, no such luck. The footbeds of the ""new"" size 38's are slightly smaller than on my old sandals. My toes were hitting the edge of the footbed. Not comfortable at all. (I'm a size 7 in regular shoes).

So, I had to return them at my expense, and then pay the shipping to get the larger sized relacements sent to me. Now the fronts fit fine, but on the whole, the new size is a bit too large for the rest of my feet!

So, go to the mall and try them on first before buying, for best results."
241,-1.0,2006,"I do believe that this product is a type of Birkenstock, or maybe they have a license to sell as a Birkenstock, but they are not the Original Birkenstock as they claim to be.

I did not appreciate the service I received from Midwest Sports. Choosing the size by the sizing chart and comparing it to my shoe size, I thought I chose the correct size; but it was not, it was a size larger. So I had to exchange them. Not only did I have to pay for the postage to return the item, I was also charged to have the correct size mailed back to me. In my past experiences, the dealer has always been the one to pay for the postage.

Will I purchase from Midwest Sports again? No."
290,1.0,2006,The ring is very nice but shipping took longer than expected.
1175,1.0,2006,THE HANDKERCHIEFS ARE OF EXCELLENT QUALITY. I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO BUY MORE OF THEM
1176,1.0,2006,these are very nice handkerchiefs. they wash well and do not need ironing. They are soft enough not to irritate the nose. I can recommend them highly.
1177,1.0,2006,"Unlike cotton handkercheifs, these won't shrink and wrinkle in the wash.  It's nice to know that I can still find permanent press handkercheifs on Amazon.  Fast shipping too!"
1480,1.0,2006,"I had my son at the beginning of April and he's now right at 12lbs and still wearing them.  They do shrink...the sleeves are now 3/4 legnth, but they are soft."
1481,1.0,2006,"We really like these - except they are not 100 % cotton- as advertised.

oh well"
1484,1.0,2005,My husband is very happy with a case to hold all his watches.
1489,1.0,2006,"Good construction, but I was a little disappointed, at first. The higghly glossed finish made it look ""plasticky"". But my mom lover it !. Must be genetically encoded for those above 60 years to be thrilled at things shiny <laughter>"
1490,1.0,2006,I ordered the watchbox for 20 watches in August 2006. The delivery of the box was flexible and the box arrived quickly. It took only a couple of weeks and the price of the box was reasonable. With the box itself I am very satisfied.
1491,0.0,2006,"The storage box looks, feels, and even smells great. the see through pane on the top even makes it look really expensive, and it really does its job. Down side is that it does its job on the top deck, the bottom part of the storage unit is very thin, large watches won't fit in the bottom drawer. if u have 10 big/ wide watches and some thin ones, you'll be fine."
1492,1.0,2006,"This is a fantastic watch display/storage case.  It is of quality construction and looks very elegant.  Each watch compartment has a nice leather type crafted pillow for your watch to wrap around.  These are nice pillows and of good construction.

The display case has plenty of room between the watches and the glass.  There is even enough room, both on the pillow and between the pillow and glass, to show off pocket watches.  This case shows off your watches very nicely.  Even my el-cheapo timex watch looks good in this case.

If I had to find something lacking, I would have but one VERY MINOR suggestion.  I think each watch compartment should be just a tad bit deeper or longer so that I could store any watch band links right with the appropriate watch.  I'm able to do that now, but not in a way the hides the extra links very well.  Like I said, a very minor complaint, not even big enough to lose a star to.

I love this case and would truely recommend it to anyone needing a place to both store and show off their watches (pocket watches included)."
1493,1.0,2006,"the box is very nice.  However it arrived with a chip broken off the bottom left corner.  Due to the color of the veneer and the underlying material, the damage is very noticeable."
1494,1.0,2005,"I'm very satisfied with this product, it has a great looking and an afoordable price."
1662,1.0,2006,Great Hat.  Packs well.  I don't look stupid.  Offers excelent sun protection.  Tend to shrink after diving in pool.  Will purchase again.
1663,1.0,2006,Great product. Fast shipping. Thanks.
1784,1.0,2006,"The merchandise was beautiful, and the shipping was surprisingly quick.  I'd order from them again."
1791,1.0,2005,It woul be good if I could purchase two shorts of different colors on the same order
1796,1.0,2006,"Excellent product, good service.  Hard to find item in most stores."
1798,1.0,2006,An excellent value - but without permapress they'll be a little wrinkled straight out of the dryer.
1799,0.0,2006,"We use 100% cotton handkerchiefs instead of Kleenex in our house, so I keep several dozen on hand.  I wash them in hot water and bleach them frequently, especially during cold and/or allergy season.  I bought two dozen of these.  After I washed these handkerchiefs for the first time, hems on about 1/3 of the handkerchiefs showed signs of fraying. I think that the quality of the cotton cloth is fine, but the tiny hems don't have enough seam allowance to prevent the fraying. I intend to pull out my sewing machine and repair the frayed hems right away, and I feel sure that the handkerchiefs will serve us well after that.  I didn't want to pay top dollar for handkerchiefs when we use so many."
1800,1.0,2006,"After a LOT of searching on the internet, I found these, 100%, cotton handkerchiefs and use them every day! The product is perfectly what I wanted and I couldn't be happier!"
1801,1.0,2006,A perfect belated Christmas gift for my father- quality and a good price!
1891,-1.0,2006,"This is more of a costume item for an adult or older child than a toy for a young child.  There are only two working buttons, one to open the visor and one that repeats a single message through a crackly speaker.  There is some padding on the top, but not enough.  The manufacturer acknowleges this by including a note suggesting that more padding be added.  Overall not a good value at all for the price."
1892,1.0,2006,"I bought this helmet hoping that it would be big enough to fit an adult.  I was pleasantly surprised when it was big enough to wear comfortably!  While there is no headband or suspension, the inside is padded with foam, and the whole thing is light enough that it was very comfortable.

Any helmet can get stuffy to wear, but the front visor opens up so much that it is very easy to breath, and you could wear this for hours.  The electronics are an inside speaker that repeats the same sequence, and the microphone doesn't work, but the overall look is so good that it doesn't matter.

I plan on putting together an astronaut suit for this, and it would be a perfect outfit for Halloween parties!"
2274,1.0,2006,"Like most ""tall"" people, I hesitate buying pants online, in any form. But I figured, since these are just for working out, what's the difference. I was pleasantly suprised when these pants arrived. They were actually long enough for me...I'm 5'll"" and the medium was just right, even in the length. I also loved how super stretchy they are."
2275,1.0,2005,This is absolutely the most comfortable pair of pants that I've ever worn.  The extra bit of spandex (10% as opposed to most pants' 5%) allows the maximum movement without losing the shape of the pants.  These pants are so great that I just bought another pair for myself and highly recommend them to other women.
2278,1.0,2006,"Dealing with jewlery salespeople is like dealing with car dealers.... misearble.  Using Amazon to buy the engagement ring was the best decision I could have made.  Such an easy process, such a great price, and the customer service was superb.  There was a slight delay in delivery (one day) and I had an email letting me know to expect the delay, and a refund of $70 for the inconvience.  The ring showed up looking exactly like I thought it would, my fiance loved it, as has everyone she has shown.  I would recommend getting your ring on Amazon to anyone I know."
2279,0.0,2005,"I whish Amazon would pay more attention to details, when a customer pays $6K for a product. Remember that when I go to buy a ring in a store, the level of service is quite different compare to Blockbuster. You offer far more info on DVDs, then on a ring. I do expect actual digital pictures of the ring to be sent before the actual shipment in very high resolution.

The bad and very bad:

1. The proportions of the diamond to ring are not even close to the diagram.

2. 18K white gold is not even close to white, and you better have it in bold! Usually, rings like this are covered with Palladium, but not here.

3. Packaging is rather cheap. Would be OK for a $300 ring, but not for $6K

4. It was 2 days late. Once again, it would be OK with a DVD...

5. Engraving on the ring says ""Amazon"" in bold. It's not what I expected. So, have it in bold as well!

6. I do expect, at least, direct e-mail/chat support before and after the large purchase like this. Not just return policy.

7. Back to pictures. Usually, when you buy the stone in a store, you have an opportunity to look at the diamond with 10x magnification. So, I expect the picture like this when I select the diamond.

The good:

1. Having the scan of the diamond certificate is great.

2. Automated diamond search system is very good.

3. Looks like the craftsmanship is good."
2436,1.0,2006,"this tiny silver frog is adorable!!

but the part that fits onto your ear is totally hard

to pry open. my fingers hurt!

ditto my ear.

but the shape is so cute that i took away just one star

tee hee:-)"
2828,1.0,2006,These are very pretty earrings that catch the light and sparkle.
2886,1.0,2006,"I just received this beauty and WOW! I coupled this with some stackable cz and tanzanite rings and I must say, I couldn't BELIEVE how real and gorgeous it looks! WHAT A GREAT DEAL! Definitely recommend it for those of us who love the look and can't afford the real thing."
2887,1.0,2006,"I bought this ring recently and the stone and setting is gorgeous! The ONLY thing that I don't like it the flatter shape band. I like a raised band on a solitaire but that is a personal preference and in no way reflects the quality of the item. For the price, I would highly recommend!!"
4621,1.0,2006,"Briefly, I had a childhood accident 30+ years ago that caused arthritis in my foot.  Not bad, but a constant, nagging pain sensation that I learned to just live with.  Finally, I saw a podiatrist who referred me to a pedorthist to be fitted with footwear that could alleviate my pain.  I wound up with a pair of Birkenstock sandals and I've never turned back.

They're great.  No more foot pain, period.  I wear dress socks and the sandals to work everyday (in an office environment -- I got flack for that from co-workers, but the needling didn't bother me and management never took me to task, either), to church, everywhere.  I've a different pair of Birkies for the beach and lawn work -- not as comfortable as the suede uppers on these Arizona's.  The mocha suede straps have held up wonderfully despite getting wet and lightly soiled from time to time.

Admittedly, it's a lot of money to spend, but the shoe store my pedorthist works in re-soles the Birkies for about $30, and will replace the cork and sole both for about $50.  The re-soled sandals last about a year, but remember, I wear them daily and I often walk a few miles each day.

In short, these sandals have dramatically improved the quality of my life and foot arthritis is no longer any concern for me.  Not bad for a little more than $100."
4708,-1.0,2006,"When I bought this item, the idea was to use it when I workout or go running.  What I found when I recieved it was that it was really really cheap.  The silicon is thin.  That wouldnt be so bad if the plastic belt clip and the armband did not use that as the means of holding on the the IPod.  The thing feels like if I were to jump hard enough the IPod would fall out or would tear the silicon.

In my opinon, if you are planning on getting this case as a means for holding your IPod while working out or for the use of the belt clip do not get it. This thing is too cheap to hold on to your 250 - 350 dollar ipod. But if you are looking for a cheap functional case for your IPod so that it does not get scratched, go ahead and get it."
4709,1.0,2006,"This case keeps your iPod the way it's meant to be, THIN.  I have the pink case which looks great with my white iPod.  And it fits perfectly.

It is a little more costly with the shipping, but you get the armband, etc. etc.  Haven't used any of the accesories yet.

TIP:  If you're putting this case on a brand new iPod, peel up the original plastic protecting the front of the iPod and cut just below the screen.  This way, your screen will still be protected in the original packaging and you can save the screen protector they send for a replacement.

I do wish it covered more of the silver part near the USB and the armband holes in the back, but hey, obviously I understand you need to be able to plug it in and get the armband through. The hold switch and headphone cutouts are perfect."
4710,1.0,2006,"The material feels nice and soft but do attract some dusts. It fits my 30gb iPod video perfectly. It also comes with a cheap plastic screen protective guard, belt clip, silver lanyard, armband and a cellular phone booster chip?? (Not sure what this has to do with the iPOD).

Anyway, go with this if you are not looking to spend a lot of money on a decent case. But however adding the shipping cost will double the amount they ask for."
4711,0.0,2006,"Well i really like the material, bacause it's soft and the click wheel feels great when you scroll. i haven't tried the armband yet because i'm scared my ipod will fall out. it's on the cheap side. The screen protector is really great, all you have to do is smooth out the bumbs with a credit card. It also came with a little necklace thing to wear with your ipod. still can't figure out how to get it on. the armband also does not fit my girly arms. anyway, it good for the cheap price. you get what you pay for."
4712,1.0,2006,"I'm not a runner and I don't jog however, I do bike and use various exercise equipment.  For my purpose this is great.  My iPod is protected, love the light weight of the case, the armband has a very wide and long velcro closure and adjusts well to lower and upper arm areas.  The color of case does make the viewing screen area the same color of case but while I'm excersing I'm not looking at my display every 5 minutes, this is meant to be a convenience tool.  Excellent price too."
4713,-1.0,2006,"The case itself protects the iPod very well, however if you try to use the armband for running - forget it. The material is too flimsy to give good support. My iPod bounced around on my arm so much that it froze in the middle of my run!"
4714,-1.0,2006,The screen film leaves bubbles which affects your display.  Using the exterior A/V out will not show the picture because the case keeps the plug from being inserted all the way.
4715,1.0,2006,this case is perfect u get a free armband and it comes with a beltclip thats cool the black one looks awesome it protects everthing it comes with a screen protector and it protects the whole ipod body this is also a good case cuz it don't take alot of space in ur pocket its a pretty awesome case i use it when i run  and sometimes when im  playing basket ball with my friends if u love ur ipod and u don't want it to get all scratched this is a good case for that
7891,0.0,2006,"It's ok, but looks a little cheap (even though it is) and it's too big and heavy for what I was looking for.  I do not believe this costs $124.00 as retail price.  The diamonds are not even noticeable and do not shine at all."
8123,-1.0,2006,"Extremely dissapointed in the colors I received.  Out of 10, 6 were black, 3 red (2 shades), 1 pink.  I could deal with 6 blacks and 4 different (and I mean different - not all red-toned) colors, but not with what I got.  Useless.

I'm upset beyond words.  Will never buy from this seller again, and will not recommend to anyone I know, unless the seller comes through and fixes this."
8124,-1.0,2006,"wish there was a 0 star

do you people know what assorted means - you are morrons - what the hell am I supposed to do with 3 red shawls and 6 black shawls- this is not what I bargained for I could give them to friends but I don't have 6 girl friends I want somebody to fix this  or I will never use or shop Amazon ever again

I have never been so unhappy with a purchase in my life

hope you have a merry Xmas - I am not"
8125,1.0,2006,"The product is lovely, don't get me wrong -- just be sure to note that you can -- and probably will -- get color duplication. I made the silly silly mistake to order two sets all at once (greater chance of getting all the colors, right?) Yeah . . . no. Out of the 20 I have, I have 3 red, and 11 black. Not faulting them, because they said it could happen, just FYI . . ."
8126,1.0,2006,I can't figure out how to contact the seller but I am really interested in purchasing an order of these pashminas.  I see that they are unavailable right now and was wondering if they would be again before the holidays.
8127,1.0,2006,These are very similar to the scarves we fell in love with in the London shops.  Great price.  I just received mine and I'm very happy with the shipment. I hope they wash up as well as the viscose scarves I bought in London.  I don't know why they wouldn't.  Soft and warm next to the skin.  Pretty colors.  I received 6 colors with only 2 of them repeated in 3 scarves each.  Thank you.  I'm going to order another set to keep for last minute gifts.
397045,1.0,2005,Item came very quickly after I had ordered it.  It does just what one would expect.  The hanger is very well constructed of quality cedar wood.  I think if you are looking for a simple but yet practical item to hang your ties on you cannot go wrong with this product.  I recommend it without reservation.
397047,1.0,2006,"I always find myself placing my tickets and boarding passes in various pieces of carry on luggage or my purse and fumbling to find them at security and the gate.

I also carry a laptop, so there is more fumbling more placing it and out of the bag.

This definately helps keep things easier to manage, flip the ID open and closed, quickly take it off for screening after getting my boarding pass out, then quickly be able to slip it back on andd get the boarding pass back in a spot where I remember to put it."
397048,1.0,2002,"If you've flown since Sept 11th, you know how many times you are asked to present your boarding pass and driver's license.  If you've flown overseas, you add your PassPort too.  This simple wallet is brilliant.
What's best about this brand is the fact that it SNAPS CLOSED.  So, if you're like me, and not too thrilled with your drivers license photo, you don't have to walk around with it in plain sight.  And the fact that this hangs comfortably around your neck means no fumbling for these documents at each security checkpoint.
I cannot recommend this highly enough.  I've purchased several more for friends and family.  Once you've used it, you'll never fly without it."
397049,1.0,2003,"Excellent, it is the perfect both formal and informal carry computer case.  It's strong, well designed.  Just got it and like it very much.  I hope it lasts.  I was suprised for the well done design.  I Recommend it."
397051,1.0,2006,"I purchased the Traveler's Choice Athens Locker Bag last year for a friend for a Christmas persent and she loved it, not only for the gym but many other uses. I now, am looking to purchase "" Traveler's Choice Athens Locker Bag"" bag for other friends and family members for Christmas this year, as well as my self. I would like to ask the Amazon store to please bring this Item ""Traveler's Choice Athens Locker Bag"" back in stock soon."
397054,-1.0,2006,Didn't like the feel. Too small for my big head. Gave it to my kid.
397055,-1.0,2004,"I bought these expecting a decent pair of sunglasses, I have a Fossil watch so I am familiar with the quality of their brand.  I am very careful with my sunglasses to avoid damage.  After approx. 2 months of use one of the arms snapped.  I contacted the manufacturer and got a replacement pair under warranty.  Things were mostly OK after that -- the screw in one of the hinges worked itself loose causing the arm to fall off (easy to fix though I shouldn't have to), and part of the frame chipped somehow.  Then shortly after the warranty expired the arm snapped again.  Perhaps I just had bad luck, but I won't buy Fossil brand sunglasses again."
397057,1.0,2003,"This is a very rugged roomy laptop bag with a lot of compartments.  I fly every week for work and have had this case for three months now.  It holds my laptop, ipod, headphones, sunglasses, book, and files with room to spare and still looks great.
  The only issues I have is that the case is too wide to roll down the aisle on airplanes.  Also if you fly on a smaller commuter plane you'll usually be forced to gate check the bag as it is considered too big to go on board with you."
397058,1.0,2006,Compact and very light. My husband is happy with it.
397059,0.0,2004,"This was on my must-have list a couple of years ago, after growing tired of switching my heavy purse from one aching shoulder to the other. For the first six or seven months, it was a constant companion. The sling has ample room in the main compartment for books, letter-sized documents and is large enough to be a good carry-on. There are two zipper pockets that hold flat items (such as a passport) and handy velcro pockets on both the side pocket (sunglasses) and chest strap (cell phone). The main flap closes with velcro and at first, this worked pretty well. But over time, the velco lost some of its strength and my attempts to close the flap left me with a sling that had open gaps on either side of the purse, gaps large enough to allow keys to fall out. It gets high marks for comfort, but it isn't always convenient to lift the strap over your head. I still use it, but the hassles make it a less frequent choice , as I've gone back to a simple shoulder strap purse for everyday use."
397060,1.0,2004,"I used this case for two years as a more sturdy alternative than the carrying case that came with my laptop. It is durable, reliable, roomy to the max, and the outside pocket is great. There are sections for phone and power cords, biz cards, and pens. The main drawback that my chiropractor lectured me on was that by carrying the computer on one shoulder, I am making him lots of $. So I took a deep breath and upgraded to the Trager 740B Cross Country Laptop Back-Pack."

I would definitely recommend the item.  In fact, I bought another one for when I'm riding along as a passenger or when I'm in the dentist chair."
397068,1.0,2003,"The puppy shredded my wallet on Sunday afternoon. It was raining and not all the contents of the wallet were in the dog's stomach. It just was not usable and I still had all my ID's and credit cards. I wanted to replace it with something slightly smaller so when I went to Amazon.com, I looked first at the wallets that had measurements listed and then looked at the enlarged features so that I could judge whether or not they fit my needs.
Most of the wallets with measurements were not pretty to me and none of them came in red. I learned later that I should have checked the availability of the colors listed before I set my heart on the red wallet. The black wallet I decided upon is exactly what I wanted when I started looking through some 250 styles. It just is not red.
 After I received my lovely black wallet, I told my sister about it and I am now ordering a duplicate for her birthday at her request. She wanted a red wallet, too. Guess what? Hers will be black as well."
397069,1.0,2003,"This pack was rated very high by Backpacker Mag in 2001, but I've never seen the price go down (hence the loss of one star)!  It's extrememly light and comfortable, but may be too big for an overnight trip versus a couple of days or longer..."
397074,1.0,2004,"I used to be a very loyal Jansport buyer, but when the time came for a new backpack, I decided to see what else was out there.  I am very glad I did.

I knew this was the backpack for me when I was in a store examining the various models and trying them on for comfort.  After about half an hour of this I decided to go do some other shopping when my daughter pointed out I still had one on my shoulder!  It fit so well that I had stopped noticing I even had it on.  So I bought it!

The Pros:

- Two very roomy main compartments that inhale a stack of books and notebooks with no problem.  Since there are two, it let me be a little more organized about what contents go in which one.

- Padded notebook sleeve.  I've only carried mine a few times in there, but it felt reasonably padded from routine handling, but I'd still take care in tossing the backpack around.

- Convenient set of various pockets on the front.  I quickly assigned each of these specific roles (cell phone in the top one; pda in another; spare batteries, keys, and bus map in a third, etc.) Being able to go right to a specific compartment was nicer than rummaging around for stuff.

- Comfy top handle.  It has a very nice rubberized top handle for those times when you don't want to or can't shoulder-carry it, the handgrip is nice and cozy.  In my opinion it's far nicer than merely padded hand straps that still cut into your hands after a while.

- Rugged!  I've loaded rather large piles of computer science books into it and was likely to have my back itself give out before the backpack would.  I used to go through a Jansport every few semesters (usually from splitting at the seams somewhere) but this Eastpak still looks new after a year of daily use.

The Con:

- It lacks any sort of water-bottle holder.  If you have something insulated that doesn't sweat, you could put it inside, but that's not always an option.  It's just a shame they didn't add some netted ones on the sides.  It would have made this an ultimate backpack if it just had that.

So I've found my new favorite backpack from this (and I've been through a dozen or so in my life) and become a new Eastpak fan in the process.  For the price, I haven't found anything on the market that comes close to this for my needs."
397075,-1.0,2004,"I just bought this laptop backpack so taht I could carry my powerbook along with books.  I expected the laptop slot to be padded on the bottom, the most important place for padding since you put your bookbag down all the time.  I always gently put the bag down...yet I still ended up getting a DENT in my brand new laptop.  I've been carrying the laptop around in non-laptop bags, and haven't had any problems, so I expected no problems with a bag that was designed to carry a laptop.
other than that, it's a pretty bag w/ lots of compartments, so it's great as a regular bookbag..but the laptop slot seems to do nothing."
397076,1.0,2004,"I love everything about this bag. I am a nursing student and have lots of books and binders to carry in addition to my laptop (Apple iBook.) On a day with a heavy work load I can usually carry three books, each about 1.5 inches thick, as well as three 1 inch binders, all at one time. There is also plenty of compartment storage for everything from pencils to calculators. I especially like the clip located inside one of the pockets so that you can attach your keys to avoid them getting lost in your bag. I do wish there was more padding in the back so heavy loads weren't felt as much. I don't have problems with the straps slipping off, although the material on the inside of the strap is a little smoother than that of my other backpacks. Overall, you can't beat the price of this pack for the amount of space you get. I would definately buy another if the need arose."
397077,1.0,2004,"this is an awesome pack! i am a 6th grader and i am in love with it!!! even though i don't have a laptop, i use that pocket for my 2 notebooks! it has so much room! i keep my school suplies in the bigger compartment and my junk in the 2nd one. amazing space! this pack also holds up well in rain, i have walked home in the rain for 30 min. and nothing was moist! u should by this pack! it feels really light, and i wear it really low on my back! what more could u ask for? the only down side is theres no pocket for ur cellphone but i keep that in the little pocket near the top.
i would by it again if i needed to, but i don't think i will!
its just a must by!"
397078,1.0,2004,"It could use more laptop protection, but otherwise I have no complaints. Perfect for a college student/part time pro. It can carry your laptop, notes, books, odds and ends, w/o much weight on your shoulders.
I am getting ready to go back to school, and this is exactly what doctor ordered. Certainly, an excellent buy."
397079,0.0,2003,"Eastpak Mastermind is quite a sturdy knapsack.
I use it to carry items to and from work.  It does a great job
in holding my lunch, books, folded jacket, notebooks, keys..etc.
Most sacks I've had don't handle the weight that well, especially if you are a college student.  I have actually had a knapsack rip apart at the seems under the weight off all the text books I'm carrying.  Eastpak doesn't have that problem.
Also wearing an Eastpak on your back is quite gentle.  The straps and backing are foam, so it's easy on the back and shoulders.  The knapsacks material is also pretty water repellent.  I've gone through more than my share of being stuck in the middle of a torrential downpour, the outside of my knapsack is soaked, but the contest were bone dry.
My only negative comment about Eastpak is the no-slip straps.
They should be called ""always-slip"".  I've threaded the straps every which way and they've always come undone under the most light weight carrying conditions.  I've ended up knotting the end of the strap so it doesn't slip through.  Really not astetically pleasing, but it got the job done.  My only real issue with this fine bag.
For the college student on the go, or for the white collar worker rushing to and from work, I believe Eastpak is a good buy with some minor reservations."

397087,1.0,2002,"This lil' hand bag is a cool gift for a friend or yourself.  If a purse is to big for the situation, just pack the essentials instead.  What really made it cool was the fact that I'd never seen one like this before."
397088,1.0,2006,"This is a lovely small bag, and I would have given it five stars if I had owned it long enough to be sure that the strap won't come loose; if it had the strap connected to the bag with some sort of hardware (the way Coach always used to do it before they sold out), rather than sewn in, I would be more certain.  To be fair, the bag costs much less than Coach would have charged, and so far the strap seems quite solidly attached.

The leather is soft and smooth, and the bag will go anywhere from extremely casual events to all but the most formal; it's neat and maintains a good, simple appearance.  There's no sign of a label of any sort--I've never been happy walking around in public carrying somebody's advertising (or what amounts to a price tag).

The one thing that I really like more than anything else is the length of the strap--nice and long.  Not all of us live on the mean streets, and not all of us think that a comfortable place for a shoulder bag is right in your armpit.  The strap here is long and flexible, so that you can access the bag's contents without removing it from your shoulder, and it isn't constantly slipping.

It is a bit small, but I find it quite big enough for a wallet, a phone, keys, small pad and pen, at least minimal makeup, and my keys--with a little room left over. I've been happy with it."
397103,0.0,2006,"I just had to give it 3 stars based on quality. (5 on fit and support) Where this bra has very good support the fabric did two things that just can't happen. 1. it gets those fuzz balls and 2. the fabric literally split in the back... it seems to be the decorative pattern that compromises the integrity. (my proof is I purchased 2 and they both did the exact same thing) I stitched it up just to lengthen its life. The bra straps come in a bit on the shoulders making it nice for tank tops. Like another reviewer says, the cups are a bit narrow and prone to ""spillage"". But if you get a good fit then this is a lovely shape. I got mine on sale for $13 so it was worth it regardless that it started falling apart soon. (hand washing of course)"
397104,1.0,2005,"I own four of these. I'm very glad of it, because they no longer sell them in my size. Again I have to begin a search for that most elusive thing - a comfortable bra that does what it's supposed to do. As to this bra though, even if you don't care about the minimizing effect, it's comfortable, supportive, and doesn't wear like body armor."
397105,1.0,2005,"Ah, the search for a perfect bra.  It can be as challenging the quest as the quest for the Holy Grail, if not more so.  I mean, with the Grail, you don't have to worry about sizing.  I hesitated to order this bra for a long time, as it appears to be pretty ugly in the photo displayed here, but I am pleased to say that in person, it's actually rather pretty.  However, be aware that there are 4 hooks in the back, so forget about your amour quickly unclasping it in during a moment of passion.  These hooks and the stretchy, sheer fabric provide substantial support though, and the wide straps are comfortable and won't leave whiplash marks upon the shoulders.  Unfortunately, the bra is cut rather narrow at the upper sides, heading towards the underarms.  Depending on your build, this can mean that the sides of your breasts will squish out, which is unattractive and indicative of a poor fit, so ordering a larger cup size than normal might be necessary."
397106,1.0,2003,"This is the most comfortable bra for me. It is light but holds firmly and the straps are wide.
thx"
397107,1.0,2006,"I have searched high and low for a great strapless bra. For those who are more endowed, it is hard to find good support without having the sides of a long line bra buckle.  When looking for undergarments on my wedding day, many people recommended this bra to me. It was perfect. I felt completely supported and had no fears while wearing my strapless gown. In addition, the back sits a bit lower so you don't have to worry about it showing in the back.  I loved this bra so much, I got one in black too. I have worn these bras several times and haven't had any problems with them breaking.  Tons of brides recommended this bra to me, and I am glad they did."
397108,-1.0,2005,"This bra was great in terms of support (I wear a DDD) BUT I wore it to one wedding and then one additional time to try on my own wedding dresses and the wire poked right out of the top of the casing.  I bought it at a Lady Grace store for about $45 and I am going to take it back and hopefully get a replacement - maybe mine was an isolated problem bra - who knows?

The only other thing was that it was kind of hard to get on by myself because it has A LOT of hooks!"
397109,1.0,2005,"I love this undershirt because it is long. It is long enough to tuck into my pants and put another shirt over and it won't come out. Other undershirts are really wide but not long. The sleeves are alittle too short though, so thats why I gave it a 4. Long lasting."
397120,1.0,2006,"I've been wearing these for over 15 years and love them!  They are cool, comfortable, cute and sexy at the same time AND they last a long time.  Although I'm a size 4, I have a ""full caboose"" and these accommodate that very well.  One of the other things I just can't stand is when the bottom rides up (like those boy shorts)in the rear and these don't do that with me."
397180,1.0,2006,"I have owned this watch for more than a year.  I love its size, appearance, and ease of use.  The ability to set it using + and - buttons that change the numbers either up or down is especially nice when I have to set the watch back an hour at the end of Daylight Savings Time, but it's also very convenient for setting timers and alarms.  All of the controls are large and easy to use yet I don't have trouble with pushing them accidentally.  So for functionality I rate this watch a ""5"".

Unlike some other reviewers I've had no trouble with the watch band, but the case, which is made of a resin composite (only the back is stainless steel), has broken twice -- once on each side of the watch where the pins insert to hold the band in place.  I was able to repair it each time by gluing the band to the watch with a little epoxy, and the reduced flexibility of the attachment isn't noticeable.  Nevertheless I'm disappointed that the resin doesn't seem to be able to hold up to the force of ordinary use.

I'll replace this watch when the battery runs down (and it's still going strong after more than a year). At that time I'll look for a model with an all-stainless steel case."
397181,0.0,2005,"I bought this watch for my 16 year old son this holiday season. It is not yet  past it's 90 day return, and I am seriously considering a return.  It is a great looking watch, with all the must have features my son requires... it's digital, has timers and alarms, it has a more mature, sophisticated look (compared to his previous vinyl banded ironman watches), and we thought it would be able to take the active lifestyle of a teenage boy, all this with a reasonable price tag and the Timex name.  Unfortunately we have not had very good luck with the band being durable. In less than 6 weeks it has fallen apart or broken several times. I have called Timex and although the band is mentioned in the warranty as not being covered, they  mailed us a new band. I paid a jeweler to replace the band. Although I was totally capable of doing the job myself, my rational was that I would be better off with a professional doing the work since I now knew this was a very fussy band. Well less than two weeks after the jeweler replaced the band it has fallen apart again!  This time it is at the junction where the band attaches to the watch. This should be easy to fix...but the reason it has fallen apart is because it is such a tight fit that it doesn't quite snap into place. So it holds temporarily, but eventually pulls apart.  My son and I really like everything else about this watch other than it's troublesome band, we haven't found another suitable replacement so we aren't quite ready to give up on it.  We are hoping our experience is an unfortunate fluke and that we bought a lemon.  We will be contacting Timex again to hopefully solve our problem."

The only problem I've had is with bands rotting out in the first year or so.  I thought that the metal band would help, and it did.  The watch was a joy until one day I wore it to the pool with my kids.  I wasn't in the pool 5 minutes when I looked down and saw that the watch had gotten some water inside.  Not much of a tri-watch.  I let it sit on a shelf for a couple weeks, and it dried out and seemed to function fine, but the next time I went outside in the rain, it got wet inside again.  I'm sure this was a warrantiable situation, but, like most folks, I generally toss the warrenty info on cheap watches.  Oh well."

This particular pair is so lightweight that you don't even feel them, the titanium is why the price is so high.  I shopped around, both in stores and online and Amazon has the best price around.

UPDATE 9/9/2006
The lenses started cracking where the nosepiece goes through them so I sent them to Maui Jim in January 2006 with $80 for lens replacement.  They replaced the lenses and had them back to me in less than a week.  Now, after less than eight months they are broke again.  Do not buy these sunglassess.

They're small lenses, but they are high quality glass.  I'd never tried the Serengetis with polarization before, and I like them outdoors.  The only drawback I'm having is wearing them in my motorcycle helmet - the polarization causes funny interactions with other external UV coatings, it's probably normal.

They are nice for the price, but I just don't understand how any reviewer can say these are ""thick"" wool socks.  I would classify them as relatively ""thin"" wool socks.

Let me repeat, these aren't bad socks, they actually are very nice and have worked great for me with a pair of tight fighting boots I own.  I just want to make people aware that these are not the ""thick"" wool socks some people envision prior to purchasing."

They are lightweight and have grippy rubber on the arms to help hold them in place. They wrap around the head, which is important for blocking light from the sides. If you're not sure whether your little one will wear sunglasses, start with something less expensive.

Sideways you can fit it very easily, but some airlines recommend against this position as it may leave less room for other customers with similar carry-on suitcases."
397299,1.0,2003,"I was very surprised to receive these earrings for Christmas.  I know that these will become my go-to pair of earrings.  They are big enough to be seen, but not so gargantuan that they are overly-heavy or hoochie.  I especially like the little pouch included to keep them in.
Great bargain and great item."
397304,0.0,2005,"This is a nice little hoop earring. I have been looking for a really small pair of white gold diamond hoop earrings and these were exactly what I had in mind. The problem is that the diamonds are not very good quality. The diamonds are quite cloudy, but since they are so small, you really can't tell unless you look very closely. There is still some sparkle, mostly from the white gold prongs that hold the diamonds in place. If it were not for that, I would rate them 5 stars. I did keep them because the size is so perfect and the price was right, plus free shipping. Overall, they are OK."
397305,0.0,2004,"I ordered these earrings for my Mom for Christmas... she actually picked them out & had seen the size indicated online & thought they'd be ok, but after she received them we realized they're actually quite small!! So just factor in to purchasing them that these are pretty teeny earrings. Other than that, they're nice - just to small for what my Mom was hoping for."

Overall, very happy with the service and product from amazon.com....THANKS!"
397327,1.0,2006,"This ring looks great, my husband love it. The fact that it's only 2mm Half Round Band, gives it a very different look. We received in less than two, we were very pleased. A great quality for the unexpensive ring, you could save the rest of the money for the honeymood....as we did!!"

397329,0.0,2005,"This ring is very delicate in appearance and is comfortable, however, the gold is dull and somewhat bronze-like in color.

I cannot wear it next to my other white gold jewelry, as it just looks drab. I also have this same band in the 2.5mm width... shinier and brighter and much prettier, without being too wide. I highly recommend the wider version. You'll be pleased with that one."
397330,1.0,2004,"The item was not quite what I was expecting.  Although I knew that the length of the necklace was 16 inches, not seeing the whole necklace in the picture, I assumed that the links of jade were going to be bigger.  I was expecting a little more substancial piece.  But, after I put the necklace on and wore it for awhile, I was rather surprised by how well the size matching of the jade to the legnth of the overall ""fit"" the necklace rather well, and it was weighted perfectly.  It was a comfortable piece to wear and I grew to love it more after actually wearing it.  A thing that I love that I don't think is mentioned is the clasp on the actual dragon is such that it can be removed from this necklace and put on other large necklaces. I have not tried moving it to a strand of pearls, but I would think that it might work!
I am giving it a four out of five because of that initial impression was not earth moving, but the piece is really quite nice.  If I wear it more and grow to love it more, I may regret not giving it a five!"
397342,1.0,2004,"This is a very eye-catching ring and looks like you spent WAY more than $19.99 for it. The stone is a nice deep color with flecks of green and red fire, and the CZs are really sparkly. I also like the fact that the sterling is rhodium plated so that it matches my white gold and platinum jewelry."

I've always been a fan of fossil and so has my wife, so i know i can't go wrong with a fossil. Though her last one got destroyed it was of no fault of fossil. These watches are durable, stylish, and fitting for any attire, and for the price a very good deal. I recommend Fossil brand to any one looking for a new watch."
397357,1.0,2006,"I like the Fossil removable links, so I can size my watch without a jeweler.  I like the water resistancy, so that I can shower without worry.  I like the sleek look.

I sometimes have a hard time with viewing the face.  Perhaps if the background weren't blue it would be easier, but the glare hides the hands.  It generally takes me a bit to figure out what my watch says because of this."
397362,-1.0,2005,After receiving the replica all i could think about was how upset i was to have wasted 200 dollars. If i can turn back time i would not order this item. I shelfed it on my entertainment center and so far my friends seem to think its really cool. Maybe one of them wil make me an offer.
397363,1.0,2004,"Remember that scene from ""Hannibal"" where the depraved and obsessive billionaire Mason Verger, horribly mutilated by his own hand and Hannibal Lecter's powerful psychosis, bought Hannibal's protective mask from the flesh-chewing Good Doctor's former orderly?

Verger paid a few million for the privilege of wearing a brilliant but mortal serial killer's mask. I paid 150 bucks and got an immortal slasher's hockey mask, made from sturdy, battle-scarred resin, and bolted into place against lush blood-red velvet backing in its ominous black shadowbox. I mounted it by a bookshelf in one of the darkened corners of my study, and I tell ya---sometimes I fancy I can see crazed, darting eyes glaring out at me from the dark orbs of that infamous Hockey Mask.

And as I said, where poor Mason Verger paid a mint to get Hannibal's mask, I get Jason's mask *and* bloodthirsty revenant Freddy Krueger's deadly claw of leather and steel (alright, alright---plastic, resin, and rubber---but a man can dream). Bear in mind that while the glove has heft as well---even if it doesn't have retractable steel blades, which was what I was counting on---you can't remove it from the box without a screwdriver. Doubtless NECA, visions of 2,000 blade-gloved maniacs prowling the countryside and the inevitable lawsuits in mind, decided on plastic over flesh-ripping steel, but I'm still happy with the finished product.

So go ahead, summon up the Mask & Glove. I'm jaded, and it was my favorite gift (to myself) in the last decade. Buy it, hang it on the wall, and give a little love to your inner Slasher."
397364,0.0,2004,"I would recomend this one only to hardcore fans of the film Freddy VS Jason. Both the glove and the mask are attached into this box, but you can get them of by using a screwdriver as long as you're careful. Unlike the hockeymask, Freddy's glove is not wearable wich disapointed me a bit. Also, Jason's mask is missing it's famous axe-mark, but since they forgot it in the movie they problably saw no point in adding it here either."
397365,1.0,2004,"I purchased this and waited like I was 12 yrs old for the day it arrived. It finally arrived and I have many questions. Now , is this really an exact replica of Freddy's glove and Jason's mask from the film? Why was the red felt back panel not glued in straight? Why weren't the gloves blades made of metal? Why was the glove not leather? Why wasn't it fitted with a glass front instead of plastic? Now having asked these questions after paying 200+ for this I still say it rules only because its probably the best your average joe can get without making his own to display. I contend a person could and probably has made an actual replica by now that is completely real! If so lets hope we can afford it.  FOUR STARS ****-"
397366,-1.0,2004,"I spent the insane amount of money to buy this and it is horrible. The ""authentic"" glove is tiny and made out of plastic(The real glove is leather and metal.. some replica) and the jason mask is even smaller(wasn't jason really big in the movie)! I was lucky enough to get a refund! Don't waste your money! MAke your own. It will be cheaper and better!!"

397376,1.0,2005,"Since I believe the 30's are the new 20's, I generally like to wear as little as possible for a night on the town.

The strapless, off-the shoulder or low necked attire that I prefer usually requires some sort of ""hidden"" support.  Especially with a thirty year old bosom!  I like the fact that this bra has a very low back, stays up perfectly, even after a night of sweaty dancing, and has boning that stays in shape even after being washed repeatedly for a year.

I totally love this bra.  It fits great and is perfect, especially under sweaters.  The only issues I have with this bra are the high price, and the excess of padding in the cups."
397377,-1.0,2006,I was disappointed in this bracelet. Online it looked to have more sparkle and thicker than it is. Does not look like a $100 anklet. I will be returning it.
397389,1.0,2004,"I bought these dolls (all 4) for my girls and they really enjoy them.  They are well made, the hair doesn't tangle like some of the less expensive Barbie dolls.  The clothes are stylish/detailed/current.  The heart shaped case that the dolls come in can be used to carry dolls around/store pieces.  My daughter (age 5) loves the charm bracelet that comes with the dolls. Each outfit also comes with 2 charms that fit on the bracelet.  This was money well spent.  Quality dolls. I hope there are more to come."

Don't hesitate on buying these dolls, they're very pretty and fun to play with.  Any little girl will love these wonderful dolls."

397392,1.0,2004,"When I ordered this ring, I thought that it would be nice.  I didn't expect it to be such an eye-catching piece of jewelry.  Everyone I work with noticed it and asked where I got it.  I've received more compliments on this ring than my diamond wedding ring, which cost thousands of dollars!  This ring has exceeded my expectations.  I am very happy with my purchase and would not hesitate to buy this ring as a nice gift for a graduate or close family member.  I only wish it came in a ring box rather than a small zip-lock bag inside of a flat box.  If you package it yourself, it will make a nice gift."
397403,1.0,2006,"This ring is really beautiful and does look very nice next to a cathedral setting, but it does have the word ""AMAZON"" stamped on the inside of it.  I'm not sure if this is common for all Amazon jewelry, but it's a little tacky especially if it is going to be a wedding band or such.  It's easy enough to get scratched off, but some people might be displeased with the engraving on the inside so I figured it was worth noting."
397404,1.0,2005,"I was a little nervous to place an order for a ring online. However, since there is a 30 day return policy and because my fiance really liked the look of this, I gave it a try. It arrived quickly. We used super-saver shipping, and it was shipped UPS sign-in-person delivery--it wasn't just left on our doorstep. The ring is very nice--heavy when compared to the rings we looked at in jewelry stores. It is in perfect condition-not blemishes at all. Overall, a better ring for a much better price than anything we saw in a store."

Its a lovely bag thats not to formal or too casual, and the perfect size when you have a bit to much for a small purse but don't want to lug around a big tote or duffle bag.  The price is also very reasonable."

397443,1.0,2005,"When I heard that Giovanni Navarre was developing a prototype fanny pack that even came equipped with a cell phone holder, I went bananas! Well, it's here for everybody now and I couldn't be happier! I keep a few key valuables in my ""Italian Brick.""  Lets go over the list....

1.  ""Special Delivery"" Jones WWF Wrestling figure By LJN.  When I show this to people, they think it's Koko B. Ware, I immediately let them know that's racism, and it's actually Jones, I usually get a lot of blank stares after that.

2.  Switchblade Haircomb.  This impresses the ladies the most, I act like i'm pulling a switchblade ready to gruesomely attack, but then i go ""ohhhhhh!!!!!"" and slick back my hair and spray myself with ""arrogance"" (rick martel fragrance, very rare) I know how to woo the ladies.

3.  Karate Kid Bandana.  I bid on an original from the actual movie, best $44 I ever spent.  I wear this a lot, and is vital that I have it with me at all times.  Sometimes I like to show off a few of my ninja moves when i'm not in full gear I'll just throw on the bandana and it's an instant hit.

That's just a few things that I store in the ""Italian Brick"" there's just so much space you won't know what to do with yourself, you can actually carry small children in it but I wouldn't advise it. I often get mistakened for Bruce Wayne but I have to assure people that he is just a fictional character, I have that effect on people.  Just remember with the brick you can take all your favorite keep-sakes to any adventure and still look stylish and cool.  I've rounded all 3 bases just from talking about the fanny pack, it really is a great conversation starter, but when you have the cunning looks of Ralph Macchio and a kick of Jonathan Taylor Thomas, with the dressing skills of Joey Lawrence, it's not really necessary.  Bottomline, buy this, fanny-packs are back jack!"
397458,1.0,2004,"A bit more flimsy than I expected.  It consists of gold wire twisted into floral branches extending upward, with pearl and a few rhinestone details.  I had to reshape it by bending a few of the individual wire branches so that the peice looked simi-simetrical.  When they say that the pearls go all the way around the back of the headpeice, they do not mean that the floral detail continues.  There is a single strand of tiny (much smaller pearls than on the front) pearls that continues around the back."
397462,1.0,2005,"Woo woo classic Wayfarer style that never goes out of fashion.  With the Matrix being so big, nearly all sunglasses and glasses had this look.  Sorry, I don't want to look like Keanu Reeves, I want DARK sunglasses that do what they are supposed to do, hide me from the sun.  I won't spent a lot of money on three items, watches (I ruin them! Stop them dead in an hour!), sunglasses and pocket books - pocket books I toss away with each season and sunglasses I tend to lose them!  I don't need prescription sunglasses, so I buy off the rack.  If they are dark and perfect glasses to lurk behind they are fine.  However, Wayfarers are my choice.  This style is perfect lurker glasses.  First off they are DARK!  Yeah!  Second they are a flattering style that makes everyone look like a movie star.

Only, it's been hard to find them since Matrix flooded the market.  Of course, these days anything I want it I can find it on Amazon.  So imagine my delight when I checked and found, yeppers, Wayferer style sunglasses where just waiting for me.

These pass all the check on my list.  They are strongly made, they are DARK, and they fit perfectly.  Best of all the price is amazing.  You get them at less than 1/4 of the price.  I was smart and bought me three pair.  That way if I lose one, as I will always do, I have a spare or two!

So if you are wanting really DARK sunglasses, these are it!  Move over Matrix babies...the movie star is back!"

I had to email ebags to find out why.  They did not suggest another color nor tell me which colors were available.  I was lucky in that the second bag I ordered was in stock.

The bag itself is excellent, good quality and well insulated."
397498,1.0,2005,"Upon opening the packing box I was a little disappointed. I had a slightly different idea of what this bag would feel and look like.  The photo is not misleading, just slightly different - I don't know how... None of this matters though. It's like when you become attracted to the really nice, smart guy who isn't the best looking.  I love this bag, it has served me well and now I'm convinced that it is the cutest bag in the room."
397499,1.0,2006,"I returned back to school a few years ago for a new career in nursing. The books required are always too heavy and thick for oridinary backpacks and wheeled ones which over use tends to always fall apart. I looked everywhere for one that fits. When I first purchased this bag, I thought I hope that it suits my needs. When it arrived and I transferred my books into this bag, I thought Wow! lots of compartments. Easy storage. Even has a good place to store laptop and its cords and stuff. Which was cool.

The only bad thing I can think of about this bag is that its a bit heavy if you carry it by hand....of course, that also depends on how many books you have in your backpack. It comes with a separate compartment for you to carry the bag over the shoulder but the weight of the wheels and the handle makes it very difficult to put that much pressure on your shoulder and can strain the back immediately so i would not recommend it. only other thing is that its a bit bulky so it takes up more than average amount of space at a desk.

overall I have no major complaints on this bag. I have used it for a month now and it is great...for health science majors especially nursing students...because most of the time...we resort to carry our luggage to school as our backpack because of the numerous books we carry in school per day. So I recommend it for students just starting the field of nursing."
397500,1.0,2006,"These are good quality as the waistband has three lines of stitching to the body of the shorts rather than the more usual two.  The grey elastic waistband streaches to about 140% of its normal size and although it isn't as wide (tall) as the one found on men's shorts, it is thicker.  The leg openings are reinforced with double stitching.  Your little boy will out grow these before he wears them out."
397503,1.0,2005,"This necklace is very cute and will probably get better with wear, meaning that it is a little bit too shiny for my conservative tastes.  But at this price, it was a great value for the money.  The cross itself is just the right size; very dainty and pretty colors in the stones.  The chain is a little too shiny but will get better with wear.  A lovely pendant for a teenage girl."
397505,0.0,2006,"My 18-year old son wanted this cross for his birthday and loves it to this day.

However, within a month, the chain broke.  I figured it was no big deal, I'd go buy one from a store.  WRONG.

It's not sterling, nor a type of silver finish that ""matches"" anything in the stores that I could find.

I tried a leather rope, but that didn't work too well either.

My son now has it hanging in his room and it's irritating that he can't wear it.

Otherwise, it's a lovely cross if that's what you're searching for."
397508,1.0,2006,I needed a cheap watch to bang up at work. This thing is very durable and still hasn't been scratched yet. It is very comfortable and nice looking.
397509,1.0,2006,This was an excellent gift for my 2006 graduates!  They were perfectly priced and each of them have the same pair and will remember receiving them for their graduation.  This would be a welcomed addition to any young ladies jewelry chest.
397517,1.0,2006,"Unlike some others who reviewed this product and others like it, I found the mechanics of adding charms to this bracelet fairly simple and obvious.  You just slide one of the links out to full extension, at which time an opening on the bottom becomes visible and the next link just hooks on through that opening.  No sweat!  This was a great gift for my arthritic 70-something mom who has trouble fastening and unfastening most jewelry.  Since this bracelet is stretchy, she can just slip it on and off.  She loves it, and therefore so do I."
397518,1.0,2006,"The bracelet came in a timely manner and was well-packaged. However the bracelet did not have enough links on it especially if you wanted to start with only one charm. Moreover, instructions for adding and taking off links and charms should have come with it since people like me don't know how these bracelets are constructed."
397519,1.0,2005,"I absolutely can't wait to start adding links to this lovely bracelet!  It's positively beautiful.

Great value, too.  But what's astonishing is how FAST it arrived!  I received it within 2 (business) days of ordering!

Great seller, would highly recommend doing business with!  A++++"
397520,1.0,2005,"Super comfortable, the glasses don't fog up even when you're sweating, they breathe well, and come with four sets of lenses.  Easily of the quality of other top brands, but I found these more comfortable, more stylish, and a better value.

Also of note, the company offers a no-questions asked lifetime Warranty on the glasses.  If they break, scratch, bend, or anything, then you can send them in (along with $20), and they'll send the part back, or send you a new pair--effectively extending the useful life of the glasses for as long as the company exists.  This liberal of a warranty is not offered by other manufacturers."
397533,-1.0,2004,"First off, this seller has a lot of gall to put a photo of the glasses that does not match the actual item delivered (whether or not either set of glasses resemble the one Agent Smith wore is another issue).

Now, I was not expecting a high quality replica, it's twenty bucks, but I at least wanted to receive the item depicted on the sales listing.

Noticeable differences:

1)the nose piece looks very different, and is not attached to the glases frames/lenses by brackets, as depicted.

2)The glasses are cheaply and shoddily mirrored, rather than being tinted dark, as depicted.

3)the ear pieces are rounded, not squared off.

4)the frame is thinner than depicted, particularly in the ear piece area.

5)the ear pieces do not attach to the lenses in the manner shown in the photograph, rather, there is a single cheap looking bracket.

All in all, the glasses bear a resemblance to the photo, but are NOT THE SAME."

397548,1.0,2004,"At last!  I can apply a generous gob of orange flavored Crest toothpaste and imagine I am a Nascar racer!  I live in an apartment next to a highway, so the feeling is almost surreal when I brush my teeth.  Statistically speaking, many Nascar fans don't even have teeth, but this shouldn't stop them from buying this product anyway.  The cross-action bristle design is effective for scrubbing both teeth and gums.  Sheer marketing brillance."
397572,0.0,2006,"I have tapered toes, a high arch, and narrow feet; these were my first shoes. They were decent in that the support was good, and the wide platform allowed me to balance for a long time without issue. However, if your feet are like mine, you may feel constricted by the width of the shoe, since it doesn't allow for all that much movement. I suggest it for beginning students with non-tapered, slightly wide-wide feet. It's really best to go to a store and be professionally fitted. All in all, the shoes were worth the $29, but not the right kind for my feet."
397573,0.0,2005,"You know your feet the best, but for me, these were hard to break in and when they did, the arch wasn't in the right place. They were never the right shape for my feet, making them look shorter than they really are. That made it harder to get nice lines. The plie II's (capezio) worked better for me, but these might do the trick for you and they're quite a bit cheaper. These are great if you have a wider toe and a strong arch."
397581,1.0,2005,I received this wallet as a gift last christmass and must say that it is just perfect. I was looking for a slim and discreet wallet I could use everyday without feeling like having a bulky thing in my pocket. I looked for a similar wallet before but never found one this convenient. It holds easily bank notes and also has a small inside pocket for credit cards and licenses... I am just lovin' it!
397582,1.0,2005,"I ordered this wallet for christmass and it was exactly what I expected. It is very slim and still has room for several credit cards and driver license.

397639,1.0,2006,I purchased these as a gift and was really impressed by how incredibly soft they are.  (I wish they made women's shirts out of the same soft cotton.)  Everyone I showed they too really liked the cute pink and yellow outfits.  I am very pleased with this purchase.
397641,1.0,2006,"These are good quality baby bodysuits, and very reasonably priced.  Make sure you buy the size according to your baby's weight and height and not by the age posted.  My 3 month old girl is wearing the 6-9 month size. They are a little big, but thats great because they will last longer. Warning: the medium green body suit is not color fast, and will end up looking like ""camo"" wear after you wash it.  The other body suits in the green pack are color fast and will not fade quickly.  It seems it is just the one green bodysuit that doesn't hold up well.  I did not have any fading in the pink bodysuits.  All in all I'd recommend these."
397642,1.0,2006,"Very nice basic clothing.  I think the size is fine.  I really like being able to find these shades of green, though I have decided the lighter shade is really a feminine color.  This is the only brand that I can find these muted greens."
397643,1.0,2005,"The quality of the bodysuits are very good.  They are well made and good material.  However they get three stars because of the sizing issue.  My son is 10 months old and so I got him what I thought would be ones he could grow into...the 9-12 month, 27-34 lbs.  This was not the case as soon as I washed them they shrunk to about the size of a 6-9 months onesie.  The are good but if you order them order at least one to two sizes bigger than you think you will need."
397645,1.0,2005,"i thought $10 for a 3 pack... they probably suck. But actually these socks are awesome. They're soft and comfortable, don't fall apart, and work well for moderate to cold temperatures. I've even worn them during hot weather, and they breathe and get rid of the sweat better than some socks twice the price. Worth more than the price."
397647,-1.0,2006,"These looked nice, but the fabric is very cheap and stretches out too easily. I haven't had a problem with the velcro coming undone often, but the velcro isn't sewn on very well and the strips are small enough to be a choking hazard! I tore off the velcro that was coming off before it could fall off on its own. Very dangerous."
397648,-1.0,2005,The velcro does not hold the fabric closed!  Every time I would pick up my daughter the velcro would pop open and the clothing would slip up her sides.  I thought I was going to have my baby slide right out of her clothes!  Also- the fabric was see-through it was so thin. I threw them all away.  They were just a waste of money.
397649,-1.0,2005,"I was extremely disappointed with this purchase. I've bought bodysuits from different sources & they were all of good quality thick cotton. These bodysuits were very thin,& after pre-washing them (I always do before I use them on my baby), they were stretched out, so my baby didn't even wear his new clothes without them looking ""old""!!!I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It's not worth the money."
397652,1.0,2006,"This organizer is great for travelling.  Everything you need for the airplane right there - passport, pen, ID's, money, and tickets."
397653,1.0,2006,"This laptop bag is great and looks fabulous. It was original made for a 15"" laptop, but had the width to house an 18.1"", so I cut out the computer pocket in the center.  Funny thing is, the construction on the interior fabric is great, so if you're careful when you cut it out, you won't see anything at all.  Also, you can avoid cutting altogether (if you don't want extra padding) and just remove the laptop cubby and center liner with the Velcro."
397667,1.0,2005,"This is a heavy, solid ring, suitable for office wear yet glamorous enough for evening.  The pav diamonds are understated and the sapphire fits within the width of the band.

The sapphire is very dark, with very little ""fire,"" which undoubtedly contributes to the low price.  At the ""full price"" listed for this piece (which would be a major outlay) I would probably lower this rating.  However, at the ""closeout price"" (similar to a plain band ring in platinum) it made a great gift.

Kudos to Secure Hoop, who went out of their way to devise a very nice gift wrap and to assure delivery."
397761,-1.0,2006,"I have had nothing but problems with this bracelet. Everytime I wear it something breaks. Either the cross gets caught on something and falls off or the links pull apart so that the whole bracelet falls off. I've even had the center Ball on a wire peice fall of. How it came off of both sides at onece is beyond me. Whats more, it snags on all my clothing. Don't bye this unless you want to fix it every time you wear it."
397769,1.0,2006,perfect exactly as I expected it to be :) would buy from again
397772,1.0,2006,"I bought this for my son who loves dragons.  HE LOVES THIS RING. The pictures don't really do the ring justice, it has a very high quality appearance and a nice heft.  My sons loves showing his dragon claw ring off to everyone, and everyone thinks it's pretty groovy."
397807,1.0,2006,"These shirts fit my baby great (he is nine months old and a little tall for his age, but average weight).  The sleeves go all the way to his wrists and he has room to grow.  The cotton is very soft and thick, and I love the colors (I bought the green set).  They are also long on his body, so they don't ruck up everytime I pick him up."
397808,1.0,2005,"I love these t-shirts.  They are soft cotton and fit my 8 lb baby great.  Plus, cute colors and designs.  Such a deal."
397809,-1.0,2005,"Okay, so I think the low price on these is because they aren't exactly ""long"" sleeved. They aren't even 3/4 length - they're 1/2 length!  These go only up to my baby's elbows!!  He's 7 months old and is wearing the 6-9 month size (medium), my baby's in the 50th percentile growth-wise so it's clearly the shirts, and not his arms!

I also bought their ""long"" sleeved onsies and same problem."
397810,1.0,2006,"These ropes, are great for practice. I bought some for my son, they're cheap, and great for his practice lasser classes."
397875,1.0,2006,"I had been searching for a cell phone organizer for quite some time. I wanted one that I could tuck my driver's license, check card, cash, etc into as well as one that would securely hold my phone. This one really does the trick. It is small enough to grab and go, but big enough to accomodate other items besides the phone. It has three versatile carrying options; a short strap that can be attached to a larger bag or purse, a longer strap that can be slung across the shoulder, and a belt clip with a snap closure. It is made of durable nylon that is sturdy yet stylish. It costs a little bit more than I had wanted to spend, but, in the end, I decided it was well worth the money."
397880,0.0,2005,I ordered the Only. Bagg Tote to use as a carry on for a European trip.  While it is sturdy and extremely attractive the interior zip compartment is the only usable section of the bag.  The side compartments close with magnetic fasteners which hold only so long as the compartments are empty.  I found the center compartment usable only when it was stuffed to the hilt.  The soft sided Baggallini Only. Bagg Tote just doesn't lend itself to being a carry on.  I much prefer my older bag in a pouch Baggallini's.
397891,1.0,2006,"This was the ""man-liest"" claddagh ring I could find for my guy. I got it today within 4 days of ordering it. It looks really nice, came ahead of time, and comes in a great leather ring box. And it is quite affordable. Only complaint is the note that I wanted to come with it is cut-up computer paper taped to a card. :/ But for the most part, it is great. Just hope it fits! :)"
397892,1.0,2006,"I was very happy with the product because it arrived looking just like the picture online. Also, it arrived in the time I needed it."
397893,1.0,2006,"This ring was beautifully made with great attention to detail. The design was masculine, yet included all of the symbols of the Claddagh. Most bands I found did not include the crown. It came in a nice leather ring box too!"
397895,-1.0,2006,"I based my decision to buy on the only review available. The female purchaser described this pendant as being masculine, and suitable for her husband. I'm a six-foot, two-inch heavyweight, and found the pendant too small for my large frame. The short, delicate chain did not even come close to reaching around my 21-inch neck. IMHO, it's more suited to a woman. Instead of returning it, I gave the pendant to my wife. It looks very nice on her slender frame, and she really likes it. (PS - the reverse side is smooth, showing only sand-like casting marks, and the number ""925"")"
397896,1.0,2006,"I got this celtic cross for my husband for our second anniversary.  It is larger and more ""masculine"" looking than most offered for sale.  The quality and weight are very attractive, especially for a guy.  The scrollwork is very detailed.  Recommended if you are looking for something unusual."
397941,1.0,2006,"These are the only jeans that fit my figure and I love the long length, too! I've tried every single brand of mid-priced jeans and I was so happy when they fit. Unlike most jeans that I've tried on, these don't gape too much in the back. The sizes run big so try on a size or two smaller than you normally wear. I would say these jeans are good for women who: A) are tall, B) have an above-average hip-waist ratio, C) have a booty, and D) like stretch and comfort."
397944,0.0,2006,"I had ordered this and the other related spoons with the expectation that they were tableware, but they are not. They are in fact very tiny (about two inches in length), they are not even large enough for children, but would be more useful as a conversation piece or as a craft embellishment."
397982,1.0,2005,as a watch collector i always try to keep my eye out on whats new this is a afforadable item that offers high quality the case is well made of course you can spend hundreds of dollars  for what you might think may be better but don't be fooled its not necessary to spend big money this item has  class and offers a lot christian john nielsen . now i need to update this review 12/2006 . if you are looking at this you must like watches . so i will share where i just got my first and probably only president rolex . only buy from an authorized rolex person . i used kravitz jewelers in oceanside ny . 18 karat solid president and quite a bargin . do not buy from the internet . also kravitz jewelers also has preowned rolex in mint condition . its worth the phone call . christian j nielsen
397994,1.0,2005,"I actually bought this for convenience getting through the airport for a trip.  However, I love it SO much...and it fits so perfectly in my Healthy Back Bag...that I will use it as my wallet from now on!  It would probably be too large for many purses, but it complements the shape of the Healthy Back Bag perfectly.

The fabric is sturdy, and there are stash spots for absolutely everything...including my checkbook and cash.  I really like that it zips up...but it's not ""typical"" organizer thick nor bulky.

Perfect."
397995,1.0,2006,"This was exactly the thing I needed. The product description was right on--showed me inside and out, and it was exactly as advertised. I am extremely happy with this product. Sometimes you get in your mind what you want, and can't find anything that fits that picture, but this was perfect."
397998,-1.0,2006,I was sent the wrong size ring and cannot fit it on my finger....I lost the return info.  So I have not worn the ring.
398035,1.0,2005,I am sorry I overlooked this review. The service was great and merchandise exactly as advertised. Thank you very much!
398036,1.0,2006,"Well i just bought them because i like chopper stuff, how ever when you ride your bike they feel really comfortable and their color helps in the night. i like them they make you look fine too."
398038,1.0,2006,Very impressed with the quality of my item. Delivery was fast. Would definately buy from this seller again
398041,1.0,2005,"Excellent clarity. Good, warm rose tint that reminds me of the old SunCloud glasses of ten years+ ago. VERY lightweight---I forget that I am wearing them. Developed a crack in one lens at a fastening point; not sure if it's product weakness or my stretching the frame. No matter, since I scratched that lens and have sent the glasses back for repair. I am pleased that repair is an option, because I love these glasses."
398060,1.0,2006,"This item came in 3 days and

I am very impressed!"
398061,1.0,2006,I recieved my order in a fast matter an was very pleased. I will be ording again soon. Thank You
398068,0.0,2006,I found that the watch's alarm can be very easily and consequently  inadvertantly shut on or off.
398083,1.0,2006,"Very cute and modern swimdress. I got a lot of compliments on it. Luckily, I ordered a black colored swimdress so the ""see-through"" problem didn't really affect me. I would have preferred if it had some padding though just to give it a little extra boost, but overall, it's adorable and fits really well!"
398084,0.0,2006,"so i went swimming at a public pool today and found out the hard way that you can see right through the top part of the dress, but only when it gets wet.  it is a very cute swim suit and it gives just the right coverage for being a bigger girl.  i just wish that they would put a white piece of fabric up on the top part of the suit so that it would be appropriate to wear at a public pool."
398085,1.0,2006,"I was looking for a swimdress that looked modern and nothing like what my mother used to wear--- and I found it in this suit!  Love the halter styling and empire waist.... gives it a really young and hip look.  My only complaint is that there are no soft cups up top.  The white is sooo cute, but your girls will show right through!  I liked the suit so much that I spent $20 to have a tailor add some cups to give the coverage it needs, and give me the little lift that I need! ;)  The rest of it is not see through and is lined with a nude lining so you can kind of see the attached panties through (making it appear like a 2 piece)---which also helps to mod it up~!  So, for me, would have been perfect if they had just gone one step further and added a little support up top."
398097,-1.0,2005,"a)the quality is not that great.

b)the socks are not skid proof.

BUT

its good to have 8 pairs because somehow the curse of missing socks will hit babies socks too. sometimes they pull them off while takig a walk, at restaraunts, friends' homes, and sometimes the dryer eats them.:)"
398098,1.0,2005,"These glasses are simply the best.  I bought two pair and used them extensively in Kuwait and Iraq.  Believe me, the sun is a killer there.  Further, these glasses helped to keep out sand during sand storms.  I highly recomend this product as they are the only sun glasses I will ever wear again."
398140,-1.0,2005,"I received this as a gift, and I was pretty disappointed.  The skirt and pants are great and I wear them all the time, but the shirt and dress never fit right, even toward the end of my pregnancy.  I definitely would not buy this set for myself, since it's so expensive.  Instead I'd get the pants and skirt separately.  I bought similar pants from another website for $15, and I'm sure a similar skirt is out there for under $50."
398141,-1.0,2005,"I was very eager to get this set after getting the dress from the regular survival kit as a hand me down.  The problem I have with the warm weather set of clothing is that its designed for tall women.  The pants are several inches too long (I'm 5'2, which is not all that short, esp with shoes!) The dress hangs off me like a sack, even though I am 7 months along.  I have gotten a good bit of use out of the skirt and shirt, so its not a total loss. However the shirt no longer fits since I have gone from an A to a C cup. I imagine anyone who began her pregnancy with a medium to large sized bust won't be able to wear it for more than a couple of months. If I had to do it over I would have used the $150 to buy nice individual items that would have actually fit!  I wouldn't recommend this set unless you can try it on before purchasing."
398156,1.0,2006,I'm a guy too- excellent glasses-- looks and feels great!  These glasses are durable and are not flawed in any way.. they were delivered fast and i've been wearing them for months now problem free! The polarization helps me not get sun headaches.
398157,-1.0,2006,"I bought the blue shaded version of the Eastbay polarized sunglasses and received a pair with horizontal distortion lines in the lenses. If you wear these often, I am sure it will kill your vision after a while. It is a pitty, because they fit snug, look nice and give good protection, but totally useless as focusing through those lenses is impossible. I have contacted Eastbay about it but they seem to busy to reply, after all, I only lost 7 us$, right?"
398158,1.0,2005,"I am a guy, and I think that the previous reviewer would agree that these sunglasses look great on me :)

Seriously, they are lightweight but they fit securely w/o being tight (on me at least).  The polarization is superb, and the folding action is strong and sure.

The cloth bag helped keep the cost down I'm sure.  It's fine, just be careful where you set them when they're in the bag.

Order 2 or 3 and see what the shipping cost will be, the box they came in was big enough to hold like 10 of them, and surely a few more sunglasses wouldn't make the shipping cost much higher, if any higher at all."
398159,1.0,2005,"I'm a woman, but I think these would look just as great on a man.  They're very comfortable -- don't slip down the nose or sit funny.  However, I wish they came in a hardcase instead of a cloth bag -- I feel like I'm going to break them.  Also, the 6.99 s/h fee is excessive."
398210,1.0,2006,"It's a great tote because you can fit so much more than a computer inside.  It can also be used as an overnight bag or a bag for all you ""personal"" items."
398230,-1.0,2006,"The AM/FM radio sound quality is OK - not great, just OK.  You're not going to get booming bass.  I had no problem with this product detecting the atomic clock signal.  But there were a number of disappointments concerning this product that prompted me to send it back to Unbeatablesale.com.

1)  The crescendo alarm applies only to the buzzer.  Not to the radio.  Not to the nature sounds.  Just the buzzer.

2)  It has dual alarms, but it's nearly impossible to know which alarm you're setting since it uses a pair of very small, identically shaped, side-by-side icons to indicate which alarm you have selected.  The instructions also assume that you know what a buzzer icon looks like and what a radio icon looks like, since the set-up instructions tell you to select one or the other as the alarm but never show you what either of them looks like.

3)  Of the six 'nature' sounds, the ""Birds"" is the only restful to listen to, but NONE OF THEM CAN BE USED AS THE ALARM.  These nature sounds are strictly for background effect and have to be manually turned on and off.  And most of them are not soothing to listen to at all:  The waterfall effect is a thundering Niagra, and the Wind effect sounds exactly like a howling blizzard.  How restful is THAT to have as background?!?!

4)  Like most instruction books, this one needs to be better written.  What it says you should see on the display isn't always what you see, and it doesn't describe the icons that it says you need to select as you set up the alarms.

5)  The detachable speakers don't attach securely to the main unit.  The main unit has a pair of pin-like studs on each side that are inserted into a pair of keyhole-like holes in each speaker.  But this is an arrangement that requires precise spacing of the studs and keyholes to make the two components fit securely, and one of the pins on the main unit was misaligned just enough that the speaker would fall off if the unit was jostled in the least.

6)  The alarms sound 7 days a week and there's no way to automatically disable them for the weekend.  Since there's a setting for displaying the day of the week, it would be REAL nice if you could control whether the alarm sounds for that day or not.  As it is, you have to remember to turn off the alarm on Friday and remember to turn it back on again on Sunday.  I'm astounded at how few atomic alarm clocks are provided with this feature, ands this product is no exception.

7)  I can't speak to how well the bedshaker attachment works, but if you don't need it, then you can get this unit for about $30 rather than $50 or $60.

I had higher hopes for this product.  It went back for a refund.  ***sigh***"
398232,-1.0,2006,I purchased 3 of these bracelets.  I love the design but all three broke very shortly after I purchased them.  The charms fell off.  Looks good but poorly made.
398233,1.0,2006,"I have an autistic son. I do not feel he needs to ""be fixed"", which seems to be the general feeling posted by autistics here, but to me he is a puzzle that I need to figure out. I would not have him any other way. I seek to understand him to greater appreciate his very special mind. No, he does not need fixing, but I need to understand how his puzzle pieces fit together to be able to see his ""big picture""."
398234,1.0,2005,"As a person with Aspergers, and a mother with two sons (ages 24 and 15) who have Aspergers, I can tell you that I don't know how I made it through the years sanely, and my boys were, and still are a puzzlement to me. (Albeit a delightful one) I believe I may have been the luckiest one on earth to be their mom, because I am as ""quirky"" as they are, yet I know to this day that most people consider me an ""odd duck."" I would proudly wear a puzzle bracelet, and announce to the world that I am a puzzle and hey! come and spend some time figuring me out...it could be fun and worth your time and effort! I'm proud of the paradox that is me!"
398235,1.0,2005,"Autism is not only about the person with Autism - it affects parents, siblings, and many others.  The home changes to accomodate the diagnosed person.  It involves Speech Pathologists, Psychologists, Occupational Therapists, and Teachers.  It requires a team effort.  So wear a trinket.  Show your support for not only the person diagnosed, but for the family he or she lives in.  For the school they attend.  For the team of professionals that service them.  Without research and support, people with Autism would not have the services and support they now have.

If you are truly proud of your autism, be proud of those around you who have worked with you, taught you, cared for you.  These are the people who have helped you be what you are.  Be proud of them too.  And support continued research of Austism Spectrum Disorders.  They are proud of you."
398236,-1.0,2005,"I noticed that the design of this bracelet includes a ribbon motif, like the kinds of coloured ribbons that people wear on certain days in remembrance of people who are victims of tragedies, such a breast cancer, AIDS, suicide or road accident fatalities. To regard autistic people in the same way, as being the victims of a tragic misfortune, can be seen as a dreadful personal insult to us, because autism/Aspergers is a fundamental part of who were are, we don't have autism, we are autistic. Save your pity for someone who needs it, mate!

And the bracelet also uses the autism puzzle motif that many autistic people find objectionable. One of the better known autism activist web sites has a logo on it that says ""I am not a puzzle I am a person"". It should be obvious to any thinking person that the idea of autism being a puzzle is a neurotypical-centric point of view of autism and autistic people. When a neurotypical person expresses the opinion that autistics are a puzzle, they are only flaunting their own lack of knowledge, not empathy or understanding."
398237,-1.0,2005,"I find it very strange that this product is being advertised as an ""autism pride"" bracelet, just a few days before autistic pride day (june 18th) and at the same time is promoting the view of autistics  as puzzles to be solved - would a bracelet advertising the ""puzzle of homosexuality"" be suitable for gay pride?"
398238,-1.0,2005,This item promotes the idea that people with autism are puzzles that need to be put together.  We are NOT.  We are human beings whose minds just happen to work differently than those of the general population.  I am autistic and proud of it and I DO NOT need to be fixed.  I do not appreciate an item being sold that promotes the idea that there is something about me that is broken.
398239,1.0,2005,"This beautiful bracelet is a wonderful way of instilling pride among the autistic community.

The bracelet is silver plated and replete with charms.  The biggest charm of all is the Autism Engima Puzzle piece, the au courant symbol of autism.  Each interlocking piece in different colors is rather Gestalt-like in that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  The enigma of autism is greater than the sum of its parts!

The other symbols of the key and the heart makes me think of the 1980 Pete Townshend classic, ""Let My Love Open the Door (to your heart).""  Definitely a symbol of pride!"
398242,1.0,2005,"These are great glasses hands down.  The best part is that they will fit over 99% of any other glasses out there.  So if you've got prescription glasses but need full coverage blocking out all sunlight then these are for you.

I find the design very smart as well.  If they are in your bag and you apply too much pressure, they will separate cleanly at the joints so that you can re-attach the sides if they fall off.  I have had the same pair for three years now.

One comment is that they do tend to scratch easily, and once that happens it can reduce visibility through them.

The best part is the price!  Talk about worry-free sunglasses."
398249,1.0,2005,I've used this bag every week for a month and it is holding up well to the wear and tear. Suiter section works very well for carrying 2 suits without wrinkles to your destination. I'd recommend this for anyone who needs a carry on suiter.
398254,-1.0,2006,"These glasses are just awful. I bought them for my son in blue, thinking they'd stay on better than the plastic shades he had. Turns out the band slips, so they don't stay on at all unless you make it tight and position it just so. But, making them that tight makes the lenses stick to the baby's eyelids, causing goopy eyes. We noticed this happening time and time again: We'd put the glasses on our son's goop-free eyes, go for a walk, come back and find them stuck to his eyelids and his eyes full of goop. These went into the Diaper Champ after that. Save your money!"
398255,1.0,2006,Great item! A must have for fans of Napolean Dynamite. Shipped very quickly as well. I was surprised to see it in my mailbox in about a week and I live overseas.
398378,1.0,2005,These things are SOO great. The wings move several diffrent ways and make magical sounding music. I love it. I can't even describe the look on my daughters face as she flits around thehouse with flapping wings. It is wonderful
398379,1.0,2005,"My daughter got these for her 7th birthday in October.  At first I couldn't figure out how to make them work, but after I read the instructions (duh) they worked just great.  I let her wear them to a birthday party (not her own) and to school for Halloween and they're still in great shape.  The batteries are still going strong. With care, these wings will last a long time."
398380,1.0,2005,"My 4 year old loves to run around the house in little nylon fairy wings and tutus, etc. She got this set of wings for her birthday. When you first take them out of the box, you must insert the wings into the base and set the switch on the back of the base to the ""on"" position. Then, adjust the straps to fit your child and fasten the straps in a criss cross fashion. Then press the star button to activate. To get the wings to flap, the child bends over 45%. The wings will flap (in 1 of 4 speeds) and play some ""fairy wand/magical"" sound effects for approximately 10 seconds. The child does not have to stay at the 45% angel after the wings have started moving. They can stand straight and run around. The tipping motion simply triggers them to start. To activate them again, just bend over again. The wings will flap at a slightly different speed with a slightly different sound effect. (It just rotates through all 4 speeds/sound effects.) It will, if not activated for a while, turn itself off. You just have to hit the star button again to ""wake it up"". Turn the switch on the back to the ""off"" position to conserve battery life.

I gave this 4 stars for education for its encouragement of imagination. We haven't had it very long, but it's been durable thusfar. My daughter certainly thinks they are fun!"
398381,0.0,2005,"To make the wings flap/play the sounds, the child has to bend way over (the directions say 30-degree angle, but we find it's more like 90-degrees) then stand back up.  We had to try this several times to get the wings to work. They play for a few seconds, then stop, and you have to bend over again to get them going. Finally, my child crawled around on the floor and found that crawling kept the wings flapping/playing sounds for the most part, but they sometimes shut off and won't come back on for several seconds, or until we reset it by shutting them off and on. We bought these for $21.99. When they work, my daughter loves them.  The box says they play music, but that's a stretch of the imagination. They play sound effects you would expect to hear when a fairy waves a wand, etc."

398418,1.0,2006,"I have been in search for exercise pants that truly fit properly, are well made and manufactured using quality material. . . and oh yes, are LONG enough, have a nice waistband and won't fade over time.  My search has been in vain until now!  I am thrilled with these pants.  They are everything I wanted and more! I LOVE, LOVE them!  They are showing as currently unavailable at the moment but hopefully they will be back in stock soon so that I can order more.  One more great item of note:  They are made in the U.S.A., which I can confidently say, is why they are made so well and fit so perfectly.  Thank you!"

The caps screw on and while the engineering and tolerances are quite tight, it's easy to see the caps coming unscrewed, making the ring kinda useless.  Definately advised to crank the caps on very tightly after putting your keys on it.

Additinally, the metal is quite plyable and i've had to stop myself many times from bending the ring while fidgiting with my keys."
398466,1.0,2006,Before Tamagotchi v2 came out I played with the japanese keitai which is the american v2. Although v2 was fun I enjoyed the japanese version much better. The japanese has better games and better codes to use. I didn't have much fun with the games in v2. So thats my only complaint but overall v2 was ok. The japanese is just better in my opinion.
398467,1.0,2006,I really like this Tamagotchi!  My daughter is 8 years old and it is giving her responsibility for something she has to take care of and feed!  I know its just a little game but I think it show how hard it is to keep something going.  She usually get bored very quickly with toys but these have really gotten to her!  SO I think its a good thing for kids to have and its will show them when they want a real pet how much work it is!

It looks gorgeous and wicked hot at the same time.  You could almost wear it out it looks so nice.  And it fits the body perfectly (the small size fit my more petite fiancee perfectly).  I would highly recommend this product."

398650,1.0,2006,"The face of this watch is black with white large numbers, and is very easy to read even from a distance.  It reminds me of the easy-to-read gauges in an airplane, or a no-nonsense black with white numbers car dashboard.  No backlight, but the numbers and hands glow in the dark; the second hand has a glow-in-the-dark spot.  The bezel can be rotated (counter-clockwise only) so you can keep track of elapsed time or countdown time, although the numbers and tick-marks are engraved black on dark bronze gunmetal and might be hard to read in some lighting.

The strap has velcro, and the case is held in place by black elastic cloth, which sits between the case and the strap.  The good news is it allows some give if the case snags on or bumps into something; the bad news is the case sits very high above your wrist and is unnecessarily chunky.  I replaced the original strap with a more traditional strap (20mm, BTW, selection can be limited at this size) to get the case to sit on my wrist without intervening layers.

I set it to a clock synchronized by the radio signal of the national USA timebase (the so-called atomic clock) a week ago; it's now about 3 seconds behind, well within a typical accuracy spec of +/- 30 sec/month.

I'd have given it 5 stars if it had some form of lighting other than glow-in-the-dark, and perhaps a more traditional strap."

398686,1.0,2006,"These are the best slippers ever.  I should know as I'm always in search of something comfortable to wear on my feet since gravity has taken over my body.  These slippers are soft, the foam is fantastic and can make any sore feet feel better. After putting them on it is almost impossible to resist saying, ""Ahhhh!"" They hold up quite well even after numerous washings.  My first pair is well over 2 years old and still going strong.  Remarkable since I have worn them every day for the entire two years except when they are drying from being washed. I'm only buying another pair for a change of color. You can't go wrong with a pair of these slippers."
398687,1.0,2006,"I love flip-flops and really enjoy these slippers. They are very well made of nice, soft terry, fit great and are comfortable and warm even though they are open on the top. The footbed in nice and thick and also wide so no toes hanging over the edge. They're also washable - how cool is that! I'll definitely buy another pair maybe just to get another color.

UPDATE: It's 2009 and my slippers are still in good shape!"

Wearing it either across my chest or on my shoulder is comfortable.  The weight is distributed very well and the strap doesn't dig in.  The magnets holding the flaps are sturdy but not overly so.  This bag is perfect!
398714,1.0,2006,"I love this handbag.  The shoulder strap is the perfect length--not too short and not too long--and adjustable.  I love the style with the outside flap pocket on the front and the zipper pocket on the back.  And I love the color; it matches almost everything.

However, since this print was no longer available a substitute was sent; it was nice that the manufacturer included a toll-free number for the consumer to contact regarding this.

398819,-1.0,2006,"This product is so poorly made...I bought a pair and one of them broke the second time I used it.  The plastic nut inside the shoe stretcher broke.  When I received a replacement, the same thing happened.  The wood inside is not even shellacked.  This is what you get for stuff made in China.  The only reason I gave it one-star is because if the product was better quality, it actually works in stretching the shoes."
398820,1.0,2006,"These are well made shoe stretchers. They do a great job of stretching both width and length of shoe at the same time. or just width of shoe. or just length of shoe. Very easy to adjust. I also like the fact it can range from womens shoe size 5 to womens shoe size 9. So I can use them and so can my roommate who wears shoes 3 sizes bigger than me.

I ordered these from ""as seen on TV"" which includes a pair of shoe stretchers. That means two shoe stretchers, so you can stretch both shoes (left and right) at once. Both shoe stretchers work in either left or right shoe. The price is really good because when I shopped around a lot of places wanted the same money for just one shoe stretcher."

398844,-1.0,2002,"Being a frequent flier, I experience the inevitable arm strain associated with pulling around roller bag luggage from terminal to terminal. Travelon attempts to alleviate this strain by providing an alternative handle to the luggage that allows flexibility to the wrist, alleviating strain.
Unlike the TravelTow unit, a similar but more robust device, the execution of Travelon is sub-par with expectations. I will attempt to highlight some of these deficiencies, as well as outline some of the device's strengths.
Connecting the unit to the bag is a fairly straightforward process, made easy by the provided clip. The single strap provides no stability for the handle, however, which falls down as soon as you release it. In my experience with the product, I more often than not, just grab the existing handle rather than fish for the Travelon unit.
In addition, the handle does not offer a truly free rotation but rather, it forces the user to twist the strap 90 degrees in order to maintain a more ergonomically sound hand and arm position. This twist actually works against the natural weight of the luggage which creates a tension as the luggage tries to untwist the strap.
The actual process of manipulating the luggage once the handle is attached presents unique dilemna with Travelon. My luggage has a handle release level in the center of the handle - very common on roller luggage. With these buttons it is impossible to attach the Travelon unit to the center of the handle. The strap will fasten to one side or the other, resulting in a skewed pulling position from the corner of the handle. Again, a competing product, TravelTow, supplies two straps and a space in the center to fit handle release buttons - a much better design.
Overall, the Travelon is a product that is sound in concept, and does provide some relief from pulling roller bag luggage. It appears to be durable and the straps were strong enough to pull even my bulkiest bag. Real-world use of the bag delivers somewhat disappointing performance with an almost cheap feel. A more stable and ergonomic alternative would be the TravelTow which picks up where this device leaves off."
398883,1.0,2006,"Playmates rushed this product out to compete with the influx of collectible miniature games.  They got into some legal issues with another product, and subsequently ceased development/production.  There was to be a DC Comics counterpart to the game by November, but alas, no more.

399027,1.0,2004,"I was a little leary in buying a ring from Amazon, sight-unseen, but my fiance's decision to try it and the 30-day return policy made it easy. The ring came on a Wednesday after ordering on a Saturday. It came in a jewelry box (blue velvet) which I was worried about. I took it out of the box to present to my fiance and the first thing I did was look on the inside and there I saw 'PLAT' stamped. I dropped it into the palm of my hand and was immediately impressed with the weight and heft of this ring. It slipped on nicely and looked wonderful. Unfortunately I had to take it off him and fought for a while, deciding we might want to go up 1/2 a size.

I returned the ring and within 3 days, the CC was credited and I bought the 2nd ring, this time in the right size. This style of platinum ring was $1300-1600 at our local jeweler. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Amazon as a source for fine jewelry."
399028,-1.0,2006,"This watch certainly looks pretty, and it is when you first get it, but after every-day wear, the gold fades and the watch is then silver.  Some of the crystals fell out also.  It served its purpose for a while though, I just wish the gold didn't fade.

My suggestion would be to save a little money and get something nice."

399111,1.0,2006,"I ordered this bag without realizing how large it would be. I had been using a very small bag and was looking to upgrade to something a little bigger and so I bought this. I am not completely thrilled with it as it is a little too large and has mostly useless pockets. It even has a small decorative pocket on the side by the strap. It does nothing. The other outside pockets are ok for holding a very small cell phone and a couple id's. The inside is black and very deep making it difficult to find whatever you are looking for in it. Overall, it is more bag than I need and am looking for something smaller and more summery for the coming months. This is definitly a fall/winter bag as it is very heavy in appareance and feel. And I know it would very heavy if filled to capacity."
399137,-1.0,2006,"this is a really pretty ring, but, since it is ""rolling"" type ring, the gems fall out quite easily.  Also, there are two gold bands, and one silver band, instead of three different colored bands (gold, rose and silver, etc), which would have made more sense.  The two gold, one silver just looks odd.  I got a lot of compliments the first few days I had the ring, but after that the gems fell out, so, I don't wear it at all."
399173,1.0,2006,"This bag is so cute! Really roomy inside, and I've had it only one day and I already had like hundreds of complements on it! It came very quickly, and the service and packaging was outstanding! I'll definitley recommend this to everyone!"

I've had some roomy bags that were very heavy, not the case with this. I am usually skeptical and picky about handbags and buying such an item online, but I was pleasantly surprised. I would buy from this seller again -- they are prompt and quick. I had it in 2-3 days from when I ordered."
399175,1.0,2006,Perfect Size for me.  I love the length of the strap.  Very well made.  The only reason I rated it a 4 is because I was looking for a red bag and this design doesn't have it.  I am experimenting this new brown and I am growing to like it more and more.

399470,1.0,2006,"Very cool! If I leave these out on the counter with my other sunglasses, people naturally pick these up and put them on. If you have a really wide face you may find them a little narrow, but other than that they are a home run in my book."
399471,-1.0,2006,I ordered them as a fun gift for another person & they think they are neat.
399472,1.0,2006,"I got my glasses very quickly from 80's Purple. Terrific service. I know the glasses are black as the description says, however the photo shows them as purple, so don't let that mislead you. Otherwise, the glasses are nice and the service was great."
399473,1.0,2006,"These are the best. Lightweight, good lens material, fantastic framework. I'd buy a hundred if I had room for them! They are really nice. Better than the description. Fast shipping too."
399496,1.0,2006,"I am sorry for the cliche title, but I simply could not resist. This is a marvelous shoe! Despite the five inch heel (which is the only heel height that I will wear) this shoe is still very comfortable, although it does begin to hurt after about an hour of heavy walking. Also, it is fairly easy to balance in for those of you who are accustomed to wearing heels over four inches. For someone who is not as accustomed to this height it may take them some time to get used to it. However, I cannot foresee it taking very long. Another word of caution, due to the glitter on this shoe it should not be worn in the rain since the glitter tends to rub off. It goes well with dresses and pants, however the glitter has an irritating tendency to snag and ladder tights, especially if they are expensive or are the last pair you have. (However, they are cat approved because mylar balls fit so easily inside and give those goofy humans a real scare.)

I have bought from this seller before and they always send their items via UPS and supply a tracking number as well as e-mail confirmation and an e-mail when the item ships. Also, they arrive quickly. I would definitely recommend them and their products.

399510,1.0,2006,I bought these as a replacement for a similar pair of Ralph Laurens that I bought  a year ago which were a perfect 10.  The reason these are only a 4 is that they are a little too snug behind the ears.  Any eyeglass place will fix them for you usually FREE of charge.  You cannot go wrong with these since they are Polarized and under $60.  The lenses are great since they are not too dark so you can see inside but the thick sides really help your eyes outside keeping out the light.
399524,1.0,2006,"Cute toy; promptly shipped, and a fair price.  (Title of toy has a typo on this web's description - should fix to ""International""!)"
399539,1.0,2006,"Decent looking cover ... serious looking rather than fun, which is okay by me. This is by no means a ""sports"" or heavy activity type clip/cover, though; the cover, which is held closed by a magnet, tends to flop open while I'm mowing the lawn. For normal walking, etc., though, it's more than adequate. I would buy another one if something happened to this one."
399540,1.0,2006,"Awesome case for the Creative Zen Sleek or Sleek Photo. True leather and uses a magnetic button to close. Belt clip swivels to hold the player at a good angle.

makes using my sleek photo far easier on the go!!

highly recommended!"
399557,1.0,2006,"My boys saw the movie, ""Cars"" when we celebrated their dad's birthday. It was their very first movie at the movie theatre and they just loved it!

These underpants are a big hit with them ~~ they wear it every single chance they can and it is comfortable, washes well and the boys just love it!

BTW, the people who I bought these from ~~ they were quick in mailing them out to me and let me tell you, it's nice having mail-ordered underpants wrapped in tissue paper with a sticker to keep it closed. I was able to leave it on the boys' beds as a little gift and they were thrilled! Talk about treating your customers first class! It was great!"
399558,1.0,2006,"My boy is addicted to Cars (the movie) and was toilet training, so finding Cars underwear was a vital step in helping the process along.  These were the first ones I purchased.  I've since found several other pairs with pictures I liked better, but my son is happy as long as he has Lightning McQueen [...]  His only complaint is that the picture is on the back where he can't see it."
399576,-1.0,2006,"The design on this shirt is actually larger than shown, and is all in SILVER SEQUINS, not embroidery. Sequins were not mentioned in the description or discernable from the picture. When I lifted it from the package, several sequins fell off. I was very disappointed."
399617,1.0,2006,"This pocket watch is solely responsible for turning me into a pocket watch collector. All it took was just one look at this exquisitely, beautiful timepiece with it's ""see-through"" dial face which enables you to see the chinese mechanical movement, and I was hooked. This ""retro"" pocket watch embodies the old classic styling of vintage watch designs. It's elegant features include roman numerals on a white dial face and front cover, floral designs covering the entire watch, and 23 karat gold inlay on the front cover. I love the mechanical movement, which is what attracted me to the watch in the first place. The wind-up movement functions quite smoothly and reliably. This pocket watch comes at an affordable price and will make a great gift and heirloom. It's also backed by a lifetime warranty which is unprecedented."
399661,1.0,2006,"I had a hard time finding this style of bag in a size that wasn't massive.  This one is perfect because all I need to carry is my Ipod, wallet, eyedrops and keys.  These things all fit in there very neatly and no one can ask me to carry anything else because there's no extra space.  Pluse it's brown so it goes with everything."
399663,1.0,2006,"This is just really cool!  All my friends are buying one because it doesn't look like a computer bag.  It holds my 17"" perfectly and it is very sleek.  The power cord fits on the bottom so I have it all!"
399672,1.0,2006,"Stocking is a great size to fill for your football fan.  Authentic, great detail and workmanship.  Materials of good quality."
399689,1.0,2006,"Some friends of mine were a little shocked when I decided to spend 65 grand on a pair of ""test"" shoes, but I wanted to get into an elite school so I figured what the heck. I wore these when I took the AP Calculus test and I got a 5! I also wore them when I took the AP Chemistry test and I only got a 4, but that's still pretty good.

Definitely worth it."
399731,1.0,2006,"I bought these for my 2 college daughters.  Nice, girly and they appear to be well made. Lots of room inside for papers, etc."
399958,-1.0,2006,"The way the post on the earring is it is almost impossible to get in ear.  I have had pierced ears for 30 years and this is the first pair I could not get in my ears, and I finally got one in and I couldn't get it closed!!!!  Very disappointed I wanted them!!!!!!  Pam"
399963,-1.0,2006,"First this should not be called a diamond angel charm. There are no diamonds(not even artificial ones) in this pendant. It is just a thin,very small metallic plate in that shape and design. The glow of diamonds they show in the image is only to attract people. The actual pendant is much much smaller than the image they show. I am returning all the jewellery I bought from netaya. The quality of the metal is also not acceptable. I felt I was cheated."
399964,1.0,2006,"It is not necesary to have a special ocation to give a gift.

This charm combined with a bracelet was ideal for my fiancee.  She really liked a lot.

Is a valued added product."
400177,1.0,2006,"I work in a nursing facility. I needed low-cost Christmas gifts for my co-workers. I was afraid of the quality of this product, given the price. I ordered two sets and received 5 blacks per set. Each set had identical colors. The quality was wonderful. And, most people preferred black for its versatility! Everyone LOVED them!!! I would definitely order again. Thank you."

400316,0.0,2006,"Necklace came in nice black velevet pouch.  It looked very sparkly and I couldn't wait to put it on, and when I did, it fell right off.  The clasp on the chain broke.  The chain is very thin.  I sent it back and they credited my account within days."
400608,0.0,2006,i am not even sure if this is engraved or plain of what exactly this item has as far as a watch.  Can you provide some details to your items!!
400747,1.0,2006,"These earrings are absolutely beautiful! All of the items I've ordered from Milagro are excellent and I highly recommend them. My only problem with these earrings are that they were two fairly different colors, but once in your ears you really can't tell."
400803,1.0,2006,"My ex-boyfriend gave me this as a Valentine's Day present last year.  While he turned out to be quite a rat scallion, the necklace he got me is flat out beautiful.  I didn't know how much the necklace was until I just looked on here.  For that price, I cannot believe how flawless and pretty this is.  Listen up, fellas... Valentine's Day is right around the corner and giving your boyfriend a pearl necklace will show him just how much you care.  A very, very thoughtful gift!"
400865,1.0,2006,The picture listed here does not do this necklace justice. It is very pretty!

401352,0.0,2004,"I bought these back when they first came into stores.  I had the Iverson Rewind jersey and the pants matched.  So I had a ""outfit"" with everything.  Eventually a few of the buttons on the bottom of the pants fell out and I can't figure out how to repair it.  So now they are my sleeping pants and are very comfy.  At the current price, it's a great deal."
401475,-1.0,2006,The 98 MEX Jersey was the worst ever. It shows that Mexicans can't design jerseys.
401578,1.0,2006,"I bought the Osgoode Marley Cashmere Mini Pack to replace a well-worn East Indian leather organizer from Wilson Leather on clearance for $12 10 years ago. Despite being repaired and resealed with super glue wherever the stitching had failed, the Wilson was still in good working condition but just needed a new one.

After searching the Internet for quite some time I found three or four similar bags, but every one was missing a pocket or zippered section or some other feature that I'd come to depend on with my Wilson. When I first looked at Osgoode Marley's page I found an almost exact match. On further browsing, lo and behold, I discovered the Cashmere Mini Pack. Not only did it have all the compartments I needed, it was also slightly larger. One of the drawbacks to my old bag was that it was always overstuffed. So this feature of the Mini Pack suited me just fine.

Of course I was prepared for the difference in price from the ""clearance item"" Wilson bag. What I wasn't prepared for was the exceptional upgrade in quality, not only in the way it was presented with its leather strap and brushed metal hardware that was (ironically) polished to a mirror-like finish! The soft leather also really felt like cashmere and the pockets supported ample storage with room to spare. In use, the over the shoulder strap does give the Mini Pack a slight ""(m)urse"" feel, so I opted to separate the two parts of the strap and use the shorter end's spring loaded clasp looped through the conveniently located buckle hasp and clip it to only one of the side hooks. This way, it looks more like a large DayPlanner-type business organizer/carry-all.

In any case, I highly recommend the Osgoode Marley Cashmere Mini Pack to anyone who needs a daily utility, or travel pack to hold all that stuff that would otherwise make our pockets bulge, or those of us whose bad backs just won't allow them to wear their wallets in the hip pocket of their jeans."

401647,1.0,2005,"I bought this for someone close to me, and they couldn't be happier. The sharp outline and stark color stand out among other watchwear. The lightness of this watch has to be experienced to be believed: it weighs almost nothing on a person's wrist.

This is probably one of the best examples of a watch thats worth more than the price its usually found at. If you want a designer watch that will leave definite impressions among your friends and colleagues, this is the watch you should be looking at."
401816,1.0,2006,"This is a really nice case for a small camera. Perfect size for a small camera. Plus,

carrying strap is removable allowing the velcro tab to hang on your belt if you wish. This sounds trivial but it's pretty useful actually...

Has a small pocket inside to hold batteries or a card.

Go ahead get this, you cannot beat it for the price plus it looks nice.

Awesome product, highly recommend!"
402269,-1.0,2005,"Ever since Bausch & Lomb USA sold Ray-Ban to Luxottica Italy, owners of optical brands Bolle, Revo, Killer Loop etc., the overall quality totally sucks! I have a pair of Ray-Ban Aviators manufactured by Bausch & Lomb that consists of a sturdier, thicker frame. What really ticks me off is the lens quality! Ray-Ban sunglasses WERE known for their unique heavy, but not too heavy, tempered glass lenses. They are still tempered glass, but much lighter and cheaper quality. When I tried Luxottica's Ray-Ban Aviators on, I almost felt like I was wearing cheap sunglasses with plastic lenses. I would rather the nose bridge dig into my sinuses due to heavyweight lenses than wear cheaply made drug store quality sunglasses for $100!!! It is quite apparent that they are trying to starve the traditional Ray-Ban market and introduce new CRAP! I'm not buying it. To Hell with Luxottica! They can stick their inferior sunglasses where the sun don't shine!"
402361,-1.0,2006,We did not like the watch when it arrived. The strap is cheap quality. We sent a mail to Watch Values (using the link provided in Amazon.com - there was no telephone number provided) asking to what address we should return the watch. Never received a reply. We then contacted Amazon customer service and got it resolved.
402362,1.0,2006,"My grandmother was recently diagnosed with macular degeneration, so her vision is getting worse.  She absolutely loved this watch because of its bigger face and the clear voice that tells the time!  I would definitely recommend this watch!!"
402450,1.0,2006,Wife loved it. Fit perfectly on her finger and loves the comfort fit so much she hardly knows it is there. A good priced ring and a great ring to have if you do rigorous work with your hands so she says.
402451,1.0,2005,Super quality for the price.  Fits well and shines.  Good weight and will never yellow like white gold does.
402519,1.0,2006,"I have this exact bag.  It is large and very convient with the side pockets.  Purchased it about 4 years ago.  These are some of the most well made handbags on the market in my opinion.  The leather is soft but very durable.  I am very hard on handbags and was tired of having to buy a new bag several times in one season because I wore them out.  I carried this bag everyday for fall and winter for 3 years straight and it still looks as beautiful as the day I bought it.  I would highly recommend the Perlina brand and this bag in particular if you are looking for a large bag.  It is large, and very well made."
402525,1.0,2005,This pin is absolutely beautiful. I'm going to take a look at the other marcasite pieces Silver Insantity carries.
402541,-1.0,2005,"This is the first sports bra I ever bought. When I first tried it, (I was 38DD) it was extremely uncomfortable (the cups and the band) and I thought it might have to do with my size why it was so uncomfortable. Once I was a smaller size (I'm now 36D), I first tried it in 36DD, then 36D and it was still extremely uncomfortable (even when it was loose). I recommend the Shock Absorber bras, but if one has to get a Champion bra, get the Champion Inter-Shape Underwire Sports Bra (Champion Style 141), as it was a lot more comfortable than this one, even though it has an underwire."

403410,1.0,2006,"I have purchased this item a month ago and when I received the earrings they were just great. The earrings were good in color,clarity and cut. Have checked few dept store prices,ebay etc and this was a pertty good deal. I really loved them and the shine was very verygood. Worth spending the money and I hope to buy more from this jeweler when I see more good deals.

Would certainly recommend buying this product"
403421,1.0,2006,"Just got mine. I looked all over the place for platinum bands in a size 8. In my family hometown, we had jewelers tell us that the cost would be $1500. In downtown chicago, the prices got better, where they were quoting $800 for the same band but it was here for $600. I ordered it on Saturday and got it on Tuesday, the shipping was free and fast! It looks amazing and is marked PLAT inside. I could not recommend this ring more. If you're a person who prefers to save money, than pay hundreds of dollars more just to say you got the exact same thing at a certain store, then this deal is for you.

Please note that you should refer to other expert amazon.com reviews that mention when choosing comfort fit, you should choose a size 1/4 to 1/2 less than your normal ring size. I'm glad I did and it avoided any issues with the size."
403422,1.0,2005,"We looked all over for a man's wedding band in 14K, 18K and platinum . . .and found this plat one to be the best quality and the cheapest . . .All the local dealers quoted us $1100-1300 for the equivalent platinum band . . so this Amazon band was a no brainer!"

403448,1.0,2006,"Hard Justice was another in TNA's long line of great PPV's with plenty of off the wall antics,great matches,and memorable moments. Tracy Brooks turned on  Chris Sabin and Matt Bentley turned on Trinty reuniting Brooks-Bentley during the mixed tag match. Raven beat Sean Waltman AKA X-Pac,123 Kid,and Syyx in a vicious House Of Fun match that recieved a standing ovation from all who witnessed it in the Impact Zone with Raven backdropping Waltman onto the door with it breaking down and him falling out of the ring with Raven getting the hard fought pin. The Naturals beat AMW in a classic tag team title match with The Naturals dedicating the win to their fallen mentor the great Chris Candido (RIP Chris you will never be forgotten).Chris Daniels beat mexican superstar Shocker in an X-division title thriller and Abyss won an exciting Gauntlet For The Gold to become the #1 Contender to the NWA title next month at Slammiversary. Then in the main event of the evening A.J Styles beat Jeff Jarrett with ultimate fight legend Tito Ortiz as guest referee in a classic that saw A.J Styles end Jeff's 11 month reign as NWA champion and begin his third reign as NWA champion. So get it for the House Of Fun,NWA title match,and tag title match also get it for the X-Division title match,and Gauntlet For The Gold as they are both quite good matches as well. So all in all this is one of the best TNA PPV DVDs out now and if it's in a store near you I suggest you pick it up. Long Live TNA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

405005,1.0,2006,"Love it, Love it, Love it!!

It's the perfect size, great constructed quality. The only thing I would change is the strap... I think for the shape I would prefer a handle, not a long strap.  Although it's adjustable, it still doesn't adjust all the way down to a nice little handle. I think it would have been more versatile if there were both, like a built in handle and a clip on strap.

Otherwise, I'm extremely happy with the purchase."
405006,1.0,2006,"This bag is so adorable. It looks like a little pink and black tresure chest. It's got great insular qualities, to the point that my frozen fruit often freezes my celery sticks. It's lightweight and sturdy and the strap is plenty long enough. Thumbs up!"
405117,1.0,2006,"I bought these for my wife and she loves it!  (Do I need to continue?)

-It is incredibly light, very comfortable.

-It is curved at the left and right end (with curved lens) but there is almost no distortion on the vision throught the curved lens.

- Because it is curved, it prevent bright light from entering from the side as well.  Works well while driving according to her.

- overall its kind of wide, it fits better with wider face.  My wife's face is not very wide but it still fits fine.

- Because of its curve shape, the carrying case is kind of big.  Too big to fit in her small purse.  I got a small pouch for her and it works fine.

- The new Gucci logo (a 'G' of left and an upside down 'G' on right), is a lot lower profile than their old huge 'G'.  This is a plus for our taste.  Some people may not like it.

Overall, its a very nice pair of sunglasses."

- Holds 2 dvd's per movie

- Still has the open slot on the front for your DVD cover and then the 2 dvd's go in the back, sliding into slots, leaving part of them exposed for easy viewing.

- There's no extra pocket on the inside cover, that would be nice for some of the extras.

- The DVD cover pockets are bigger (wider) than my old binder - I used to have to cut the cover if I took it from the outside of the DVD.  In this one, I can just fold it in half, and it fits in easily.  Also, if I have one of those awful cardboard covers, I can just cut it along the edge instead of having to trim it on both sides."
405719,-1.0,2005,"....time. As a member of the pre-sunscreen, baby boomer generation, I've had ample sun exposure. I also just had eye surgery a month ago to remove basal cell carcinoma from my lower eyelid. Though I can't speak to these sunglasses, no one should ever buy a pair without knowing they've got 100% UltraViolet protection. In actuality, it's worse to wear sunglasses without UV protection than to wear nothing. Without UV protection, your pupil dialates behind the sunglasses & receives even more sun damage than your eye uncovered (which won't dialate in the sun.) The pupil dialation can lead to cataracts, the unprotected skin to cancer...& while I'm fine, I did lose my right tear duct & they removed quite a bit of skin in an area that's small.  My mantra? 100% UV Protection!"

I have 2 kids in diapers and are always on the go - it keeps diapers separate from snacks, serparate from medicines, separate from keys... etc.!  It isn't too deep so it's easy to get in and out of. The ripstop is light weight and water resistant although it does ""collapse"" easily (but great for stuffing under a carriage) where the microfiber is stiffer and might stand up a little better for easier viewing into the bag.

The product delivered not only has a more rectangular lens shape, the supports that go over the ears, far from being curved and smooth as in the picture are in fact straight and ""rippled"". The color isn't the same, either, although that can be subjective. Having looked elsewhere on the web, the exact same picture appears with this model on other retail sites. However, I have been unable to find a picture of the sunglasses supplied to me. This leads me to suspect that the item supplied was, in fact, the correct model but that the picture (probably supplied by the manufacturer) shows an entirely different model.

He loves these and wants to go with whichever parent is going on errands.  He just pops them out and holds our hand.  (Too dangerous by himself in parking lots and in stores).  Backyard or sidewalk is ok without holding our hands.  I can get around fast on my errands too if I have a lot of walking. Just pull the kid. :-)  My son would rate it a 5, but I gave it a 4 because he did lose 1 wheel.  He still uses it though with 3 wheels on the one shoe.  My other son has heely's and they are cool, but I don't think walking on them (like he's in high heels) are good for his feet.  These you can pop back in and you walk flat.  The Heely's you have to pop out the wheel and carry it (and not lose them)."

So when he is walking in them, one of the shoes will hit the button on the other shoe and pop out the wheels mid-step!  This happens several times a minute!  They should have put the buttons on the other side of the shoe so that they don't hit each other!  He has had several bad falls (which drew blood!)  I would not recommend these until they make it impossible for the wheels to pop out spontaneously! (maybe making the buttons flush against the shoe instead of sticking out so far)"

My only issue is that the 2 outer side pockets are a little hard to open when the bag is zipped close and full.  Even so, I love this bag."
407066,1.0,2005,"Product Feedback

This hat is a high quality item made by REEBOK and licensed from the NFL Equipment and New England Patriots. The materials used are top notch twill-type fabric with color fast logos. The adjustable clasp in the back is Velcro and quite functional. The seams are double stitched and I would assume this hat will last me a lifetime. The materials and construction are what I would call comparatively ""heavy duty"" - meaning this hat is definitely meant to be worn often without the fuss of wear and tear. The top has small holes for ventilation.

The product is better looking and feeling than what I imagined from the picture when I ordered it. The top is white in the front and dark blue in the back. The duck-bill visor part is white on top and red on the bottom, which is pretty cool. The best part is the labels and logos though... lets talk about the obvious one first. The front sports the NFL XXXVIII Superbowl Champions logo, which is a must for any Pats fan. There are two logo patches (again, top notch quality) on the sides, REEBOK and Superbowl XXXVIII logos. In the back there's a NFL Equipment logo, plus the fastening Velcro strip has a ""Champions"" label as well. Oh, and there is a Suberbowl lettering on the duck bill as well, plus two logo patches on the inside!

Price Feedback

Most hats on the Patriots website are more expensive (although worth it) than this $9.99 price tag. Not sure if I bought this on some kind of sale but I must have. Even at its regular price, I would recommend it highly; especially for Patriots fans.

Operations Feedback

I received an email confirmation as soon as I placed the order. I received the hat by regular ground US Mail within 3 days of placing the order on Amazon.com. The package was properly packed in a brown sturdy box and labelled correctly. With the invoice, Eastbay also sent me a prepaid shipping label to send the hat back in case I wasn't happy, which was a good touch (of course, the shipping back amount would be deducted from the return if used).

Bottomline

If you are a Patriots fan, this is a no brainer. Get more than one and spread the love (you cant go wrong with this price!). If you aren't such a big Pats fan, you will still like owning this hat for its excellent craftsmanship and materials (not to mention great price).

Note: The hat was shipped by Eastbay, not Amazon itself, therefore I was not able to take advantage of the free shipping offer that Amazon gives on certain items. I did get free shipping on the other stuff I bought from Amazon though."

I returned my original shipment, thinking that it was defective.

Once charged the watch runs forever. Great product at a great price."

handle it. If you plan to carry more stuff, thick books then this

Please don't pay attention to the person who said this bag is made out of cheap material.  She hurt her own credibility by stating that she just got the bag, how can you make a decision on the quality and how long it will last if you haven't used it?

I've commutted to law school everyday with this bag filled with large books and my laptop for a long time now and have been rewarded with a quality bag.

Only cons are the weak padding and the fact that the CD player apocket is not protected to kep water from getting through the zipper.

Highly recommended."
411883,-1.0,2004,"The quality of this backpack is rather poor and comparable to many that are sold at Walmart for $15.00, so I paid twice as much!  The bottom fabric is not sturdy enough to take the daily cramming of schoolbooks, and i doubt will last more than 3-4 months.  Actually, I did find one backpack at Walmart that did have a pretty sturdy bottom about a year and a half ago for only $15.00; it finally wore out and since it isn't the beginning of the school year, Walmart's stock of backpacks is too limited at this time.  That's why I thought I'd try to buy one online.  I'll never do that again.  Some things should only be bought in person."

It has turned out to be the most comfortable backpack I've ever had. Both the straps and back are padded well and the straps are wide and curved to fit comfortably. They don't dig into my shoulders at all. My laptop weighs a little over 8lbs and I can't even feel it in the pack.

My only complaint is that there is no padding at the bottom of the laptop compartment. There is a decent amount of padding around the sides, but absolutely none at the bottom or the top. I'll make modifications, but if you're really concerned about this, you should try a different backpack."

Finally got one to do it and I have to say...I was a BIT unhappy with the results. A BIT! It is really pretty on and you have to look close to see the imperfections from mounting too big of a stone in it.

I wish I had known that before I ordered it."
429055,-1.0,2006,"I am really disgusted with the Cat Pendant that arrived today.  I bought it as a gift for someone else, and there is no time to return it and get a replacement before Christmas.  The open-work cat pendant is really cute and nicely done, but the chain that it floats on is about as thin as a hair.  It would break if someone sneezed on it.  When I see something described as a ""rope chain"" I think of something a little more substantial.

The necklace arrived in a box wrapped around a slotted, folded envelope stuffed with tissue paper and cushioned with a tiny scrap of bubblewrap.  In other words, if you buy this necklace, you will also need to purchase another gift box to present it in because the one that came with the necklace looks like trash.

I am really angry to have paid $45 for what was probably worth only $15."
430132,1.0,2006,The design is nice and there is sufficient weight to make it appealing to men.
432312,0.0,2005,"I thought that a light on a watch was standard- and was surprised to see that it isn't. This makes it very difficult to see the time for me, especially since I am fairly sight impaired.  I would have bought a different one, had I realised there was no light.  This is not the seller's fault, but it was a disappointment to me."
432980,1.0,2005,this is the coolest wig ever. it's so lightweight and even fits on an adults head. it can be used as a costume in itself. these wigs remind me of jimmy neutron hair and also something that would be used in lazytown.
433035,0.0,2005,"Had the seller given more info such as the measurements of the bail's opening, this item would really sell. Not knowing this key info, makes customers uncertain as to whether or not it will fit on their chains."
435548,1.0,2005,"It's a fashion-looking bag. The actual bag is not as big as I imagine but good enough for most of my belonging. You'll have difficulty to put book or paper in it. The bag is pretty light so your sholder won't be sored.

Basicly, I like this bag a lot."
441567,1.0,2006,"I'll make this short and sweet.

I've had this item for over a month now. I must say I was not expecting much since I've had a few ""disappointments"" from online purchases as of late. However, this item was well worth the money. It looks great, and performs very well. I bring it to work everyday.

If you want a nice looking briefcase without the insane cost, then this is a safe bet. I have no complaints."
441568,1.0,2006,"Product is affordable, sleek looking, excellent value compared to its high priced counter parts. Would recommend highly!"
443133,1.0,2006,The BK Bag I purchased is the best. This bag is the right size and I us it everyday.
452225,1.0,2002,"This backpack is the best sport bag I have ever purchased.  It is roomier than I thought.  I use this bag mostly for my sport activities since it is made of mesh and it lets things inside dry well.  My toddler and I use this mesh backpack mostly for swimming.  It is big enough to fit our swimming suits, towels, baby pool toys, and changing clothes.  We do not have to worry about drying our bag when we return home.  The little zipper compartment in front is a convenient storage for my keys and membership card.  I cannot ask for more from this practical mesh backpack. You won't be disappointed with size, comfort, and versatility of this bag."
456478,1.0,2005,"This is a very resonably priced, functional, carry-on bag. It rolls well and the cosmetic bag keeps things organized and easily removes to hang up anywhere once you get to your hotel. The shoulder strap is useful to hang the bag over your large, checked bag's handle until you turn it over to the airline. It is easy to stow in the overhead or under the seat."
457515,-1.0,2006,Nothing wrong with the jacket.  I tried to cancel the order about 3 hours after placing the order and it was impossible to cancel.  Had to return the item and pay the shipping.  It should be easier to cancel if it's less than 8 hours from the time the item is ordered.
457742,-1.0,2006,"I bought another pack from this company (BeltPac), and while I did test the pack as described in the instructions, the pack leaked when I used it in the sea, destroying my phone and my mp3 player.  I contacted Aquapac, as they claim to have a warranty if the pack if used apropriately, but they refused to refund me the pack or the content that was destroyed (MP3 player + phone).

BEWARE WHEN YOU BUY ON OF THESE PACKS: EVEN IF YOU FOLLOW ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS, THE PACK MAY LEAK AND THE COMPANY WILL REFUSE TO REFUND YOU.

AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COST!"
458225,1.0,2005,"The necklace is stunning once it's out of the package...the pearls on mine are more white than cream (shown in the picture) but still gorgeous nonetheless.  The picture does a good job of conveying the overall piece, but the color and brilliant luster of the pearls cannot be conveyed.  Delivery was unexpectedly fast.  It was definitely worth the money."
458260,0.0,2005,"Considering that it's sterling silver, the price certainly isn't bad. The details are nice, it's a pretty shape, but make sure you thoroughly clean off the mouthpiece before using, as the residue of the uncleaned silver tastes awful.

Also, the opening of the holder (where you stick the cigarette in) seems a tad small for anything but cloves. A bit of a pain to have to twist regular cigarettes into it."
461333,1.0,2002,"I love it, the High Sierra Fat Boy Pack is a very nice bag, 5 Stars!, excellent quality and price, the color combination its very cool (i ordered the Black/Black/Basalt/Black model and it look awesome) and its very comfortable. It has an outstanding organizer panel and it includes an cd player pocket. I highly recomend it."
462465,0.0,2004,I bought this anklet a couple of months ago because of the semiprecious stones and it has a lobster clasp.  The stones are quite small which was fine but now I have already lost two of the stones.
468810,0.0,2005,"This Panty is certainly some way sexy, the mesh gives a see-thru look. But from a really hot boyshort I would expect a little more high cut in the back. This panty has a normal cut in the back."

469496,1.0,2005,"First, let me start by saying this: DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM FROM MACRO COMPANY!! I purchased a sit n stroll from MACRO with plenty of time to spare for an upcoming vacation. The amazon website stated it would ship in 1-2 days. MACRO did not intend on shipping it for at least 10 days! I had to cancel my order which was a disaster. The company never once returned numerous phone calls and emails I left with them. I refused delivery of the item and MACRO never credited my account for it! In the end, my credit card company had to dispute charges with them. It was a huge headache! Very dissapointing company, to say the least. We ended up using a different website to purchase the product.

  Now, let me say that I really like the sit n stroll! I used it on a vacation that I went on alone with my 14 month old. Make sure that you call ahead to the airline to see if the plane isle way is wide enough for the sit n stroll. My plane was small, so I had the pilot actually carry the sit n stroll onto the plane for me. The stroller is way to heavy to carry with one hand! I would not recommend using this item as an everyday stroller, it does not feel that sturdy. After my trip, we placed it in our second car and use it only as a car seat. It is a good item for the money. Things that I didn't like about it ... nearly impossible to lift from a carseat position into a stroller with my 23 lb. daughter inside. I needed another person's help for that. The catch on the back is sharp and I cut my hand twice trying to use it.  Also, there is really no storage space under or behind the actual seat - again, I would not recommend this as an everyday stroller.

Good product, bad vendor!!!!"
475291,1.0,2006,"On the small side, but it fits all of the stuff that I need. It is also insanely rain repellant. I got completely drenched, but all of my papers were bone dry. That is an awesome thing."
475698,1.0,2006,Receive these earrings with fantastic shipping time.  Gorgeous packaging.  These are my new favorite every day earrings!  They are the perfect size for a woman with long or short hair!
495934,0.0,2006,"I love the design on this purse. I've had many compliments on my ""Brighton"" look purse.  However, within a week of using it one of the straps came off at the stitching.  It also slumps over instead of standing up straight. You get what you pay for."
496462,1.0,2005,"I was very satisified with these shirts (I bought both the pink and the blue.) The fabric is not itchy nor soft, its just in between; perfect comfortable fabric. It fits nicely on me and I would definitely recommend it to anyone."
572651,-1.0,2006,I'm disappointed with the quality of this necklace. The setting is poor and the stones are not aligned well. I though one of the stones was missing due to this poor setting but actually it was just not aligned well. The color of the diamonds does not match either. Some of the stones seem clear but some of them look very yellow. I'm returning this to Target store tomorrow.
624770,-1.0,2005,"The new design of this bra is miserable.  The straps fall apart and the things are itchy, too!  I love the way they fit my small chest, but the manufacturer obviously can reap more profits if I have to replace these bras every few months.  Wake up Fashion Form!"
633128,1.0,2004,"I love my Maui Jim's, but I wish they were more durable.  I've been through 4 pair in 2 years.  The customer service is excellent and they have replaced them all for the price of S&H.  I'm without them right now and cannot wait to get them back.  I will be a customer for life."
657303,-1.0,2005,"The lens popped out of the frame when I picked it up from it's packaging.  The frame around the ears were made of thick, black plastic that broke after a week.  Overall:  very flimsy design, the picture is not even close to it's actual description; if you have money to waste--go ahead and buy this."
690943,1.0,2005,These are perfect for working out!  I am a Pilates instructor and love them for class.  So light-weight you have complete freedom of movement - and they dry quickly.  My new staple for the gym and Pilates.
733561,1.0,2006,This watch arrived as advertised and more.  It arrived in a beautiful box (which you don't wear anyway) and came with instructions on the adjustment of the date and time.  The R*lex I received from my employer after 25 years of service pails in comparison with this Gevril.  The R*lex given me had no instructions.  It was hit and miss on setting time and date.  I don't like a lot of gold; so this watch with gold markers fits the bill and is equally attractive.
736962,1.0,2006,"I bought this bag for my wife to take her clothes to the gym and she loves it.  There's 2 pouches inside the bag, one to hold something narrow like a cell phone on the side the other near the top of the zipper to hold like your wallet, earings, etc.  There's also a hook to hold your keys inside the bag.  Excellent buy."
736991,0.0,2006,"It fit pretty good, comfortable. I think it can last few summer. It come with a case. For the price, I think it's pretty good quilty."
